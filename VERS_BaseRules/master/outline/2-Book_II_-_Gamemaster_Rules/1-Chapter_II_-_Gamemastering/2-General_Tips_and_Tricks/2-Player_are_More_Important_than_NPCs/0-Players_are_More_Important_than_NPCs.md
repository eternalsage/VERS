It can be very tempting to create a laundry list of NPCs to fill in every nook and cranny of your game world, and in of itself there is nothing wrong with this. However, it is important to remember that you are the GM, not the player. The players are the whole reason for the adventure; they are the protagonists, stars, and heroes. Your NPCs only serve as supporting cast to facilitate the smooth continuation of the plot and fill the vacuum of the artificial world you have created, they should never be the ones with their name in lights.

Sometimes the players need help, and sometimes the plot demands that they be in over their heads. Having the NPCs step in from time to time to give a hand is no big deal, but remember that who is the star. Keep the NPCs involvement as minimal as possible and try to allow the players to have the final word or strike and you will go a long way towards keeping your players happy.
