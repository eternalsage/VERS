One of the first places that GMing can go awry is at the very first contact between GM and players. Character creation is a free build system like VERS can very quickly go out of hand and negatively impact the entire rest of your game.

The best method for dealing with this is being very hands-on with the entire process. If possible, sit down with each player individually and walk them through the entire process, approving the character at the end of each major step. If this is not possible, or if you want to create more commonality between characters, such as interesting interrelations and previous history, create characters as a group. Try and keep the focus on the individual steps and verbally encourage choices that maintain balance. The tables and guidelines are there for a reason: to much freedom can lead to power gaming and conflict regarding totals.

Finally, remember that you have the power to say no. If the game you are running is a hard sci-fi setting, then there is no room for a magic using time traveler character. Not all conflicts are as cut and dry though. Maybe in a teen-aged Superhero game a character wants to have an attribute or skill of 5. Just remember that a 5 in anything is close to peak human condition. Should a teenager, even one with superpowers, have such high skills? Maybe and maybe not. You have to make the call, but remember you are the voice of finality.

Also, look over changes made to characters as they level up. Sometimes what starts as a very reasonable character build will creep into being completely broken. If a character has not been doing anything actively or during downtime to improve an attribute or skill then what justification do they have for the character getting better in that area? Keeping an eye on character power each session will go a long way towards keeping everyone balanced and having fun.
