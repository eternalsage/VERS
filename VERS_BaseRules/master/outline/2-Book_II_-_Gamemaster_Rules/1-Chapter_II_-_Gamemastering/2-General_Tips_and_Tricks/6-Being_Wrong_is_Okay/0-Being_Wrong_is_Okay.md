Something of a corollary to the above rule is the idea that sometimes you will make the wrong ruling. Maybe fudging the dice and letting the bad guy escape makes players unhappy or makes them feel cheated. Don’t try and defend your actions, just suck it up and admit you made a bad call. Let the players chase him down to his secret base for another showdown if you can rearrange the narrative for it. If that is not an option, reward the players in some other RP way, such as extra money and gear (if your game uses it) or maybe have this victory set the villain’s plans back farther than originally intended. Be flexible and honest. The players will appreciate it.
