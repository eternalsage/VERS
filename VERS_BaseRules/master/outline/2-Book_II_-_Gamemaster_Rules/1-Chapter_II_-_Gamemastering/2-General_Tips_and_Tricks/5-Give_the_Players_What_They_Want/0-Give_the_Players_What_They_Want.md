Players hate to be captured and/or thwarted. Sometimes such actions are really important to the story, but sometimes there are other ways to progress. In these cases, try it their way, not only may the difference be a pleasant surprise, but giving the players the benefit of the doubt on occasion makes them feel more important and special.

Also, sometimes players may ask whether something is nearby, or in the vicinity. Unless doing so will disrupt the game in some way, let them have it. Some of the best moments at the table come from creatively using the environment to their advantage, and the player will feel that they made a contribution.
