Disadvantages are intended to give the player characters depth and interest. They are designed to put them at a disadvantage and make their life more difficult. Some players don’t like the idea of giving their characters disadvantages, and that is okay. Not every character has to have them, and when they do, its okay to not bring them up every game session. In fact you should be careful not to abuse a character’s disadvantages. Some players will enjoy the extra challenge, but many will feel that they are being picked on. Listen to your players. Also, it is important to realize that disadvantages are there for the GM to have something to hook the player with. Not every session will need the help, and not every disadvantage will fit the story at hand. Sparring use keeps them special.

Another key component to using disadvantages is learning how to elegantly incorporate them into the story. Sometimes a disadvantage will be obviously related to the main conflict at hand, but other times it will require more subtle manipulation to bring to bear. The most rewarding stories are those with multiple subplots, and that is where the disadvantage really shines. Hint around and build up foreshadowing and you are well on your way to mastering the art of Game Mastering.
