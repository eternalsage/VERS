There will be times when the dice and the rules will say that one thing occurs, but that event is very anticlimactic or prevents the players from getting the most dramatically appropriate result. Maybe the big boss character is easily defeated by a handful of lucky dice rolls, or a character wants to do something really cool that is technically outside of the build of their abilities. Fun is the ultimate end, and as long as everyone is having fun, toss the rules out or fudge the dice rolls.

This is not to say that every action needs to come down to court room antics. The rules are their for a reason. However, you have the final say on what does and what doesn’t happen. Don’t be afraid to use it from time to time.
