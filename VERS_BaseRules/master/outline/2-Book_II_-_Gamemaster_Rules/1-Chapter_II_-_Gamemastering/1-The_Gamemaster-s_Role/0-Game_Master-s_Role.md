Before anything else, it is important to define unequivocally the role that the GM fills. The GM is first and foremost the rules arbiter. If there is ever a question about a rule and how it applies, either to a situation or even just in general, the GM has final say. That is not to say that you should not hear out your players when they feel a rule should mean a certain thing: sometimes they make very valid points. However, it is important to remember that you set the pattern for all interactions at the table. Being unwilling to bend or to willing either way will make the game difficult to control. Be fair and just, and you will reap the rewards.

Also, it is important to point out that the details of the game’s Setting are in your hands (and your hands alone). If you say that all elves are necromancers, then that is the way things are, no matter what the players think. Don’t let this power go to your head, however. If you routinely use settings and plot devices that the players don’t like or considered in poor taste, you will quickly find they have better things to do and you are left with no game. Not every scrap of notes in your binder are inviolate and sometimes the exceptions to the rules make for the most interesting situations.

You are also responsible for plot and pacing, conflict and antagonists, and resolution and rewards. You essentially play all of the supporting characters and lay the groundwork for the suspension of disbelief for your players. While you cannot control the players, you basically have control over everything else in the game.
