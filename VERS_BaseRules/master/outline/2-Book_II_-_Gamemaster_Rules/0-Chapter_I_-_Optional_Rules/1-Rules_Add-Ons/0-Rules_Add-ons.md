The following optional rules are mostly just additional subsystems that allow for more complexity for certain types of gameplay or additional levels of character options for advanced players and GMs. Dropping these into a game will present minimal balance changes while still adding new options. The modular nature of these add-ons also make them perfect for customizing the feel of VERS to more closely resemble the themes and moods of whatever setting you are playing in.
