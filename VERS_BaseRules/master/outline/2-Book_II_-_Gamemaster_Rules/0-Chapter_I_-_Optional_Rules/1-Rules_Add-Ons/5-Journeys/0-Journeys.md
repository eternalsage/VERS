Every adventuring troop eventually goes on a journey, and for most troops the journey actually takes up more time in-game than anything else the character does. This is a system for making the journeys themselves as memorable as the destination. This system is primarily for fantasy or historical games without modern (or futuristic) methods of conveyance. If travel faster than on foot or by horse is possible in your setting, these rules will not work well.

First, there are four roles specific to traveling that the troop will want to assign amongst themselves. These roles each have a specific function and responsibilities in regard to making a long journey safely, and while a member may not handle two roles (unless there just aren’t enough characters to fill all the positions), more than one player may fill any role except guide, each helping the other. The four roles, in order of significance, are Guide, Scout, Provisioner, and Sentry.

The guide is primarily responsible for keeping the troop oriented, making decisions, and keeping the map and other navigation gear. The scout is the eyes and ears of the troop, often moving ahead or off to the sides of the group to keep an eye out for dangers, either environmental or otherwise. The provisioner is responsible for the ordering of camp and the keeping tally of the troop’s supplies. Finally, the sentry is responsible for keeping watch overnight, and arranging the watch schedule to ensure that each member gets proper rest without leaving the group unguarded.

Once decided, the journey can begin. The first step on any journey is the Planning Stage, during which the character make the preparations to have a successful expedition. Journeys are best planned with the use of a map of the setting, especially one with marked travel times. Regardless of the out of game materials available, however, the guide needs to determine the route the troop will take, which will in turn decide what environmental hazards the troop may face as well as well as the length of time the trip will take. The guide can make a Survival roll to determine the character’s accuracy in lieu of an actual map, if desired. Having an estimate for the distance, the provisioner can acquire the required supplies and divide up the loads as needed. At this point the actual traveling begins.

Depending on the time of year, the GM makes regular rolls to determine events along the journey, the DR of the roll being determined by the type of terrain. A failed roll indicates a hazard has occurred during that leg of the trip which the character need to deal with. Success means that nothing out of the ordinary happened and travel goes unhindered. An exceptional success means that leg of the journey went much faster than planned, shaving a day off the overall journey. Upon rolling a hazard, the GM must determine who the role affected, rolling 1d6 (see the chart for details). Once determined, a second roll determines the type of hazard encountered.
