Maybe it's a base used to stage a rebellion against a corrupt Jarl, or maybe its just to have a safe place to lie low after their latest job. Either way, many adventuring troops find they need a base of operations. Holds come in many shapes and sizes, but the at the most basic they are areas in which characters are safe, secure, and able to store their gear. This is represented by something resembling a character sheet for the hold itself, with its specific attributes and qualities.
Holds are built with HP (Hold Points) which are purchased by the character at a rate of 3 HP per 1 CP spent. Because of the communal nature of a hold, any hold upgrades can be purchased and shared by any and all members of the troop.

Because the aim of Ice and Iron is not historical accuracy we have taken some liberties with both the terminology and technology available to the Rúnlings and especially the Fadein compared to that of the inspirational material. This is purposeful and is designed to make the world less dreary and hopeless than any real world analogue society would have been. Don’t worry overly much about the historical details and simply enjoy the flavor of the world as it is, a love letter to Dark Ages European culture.

Hold Attributes
Holds have five attributes: Size, Security, Grounds, Location, and Luxury. Each of these have ranks from 0-5 which describe that particular aspect of the hold. Each attribute starts at rank 1, although it could be sold down to 0 at GM discretion. Hold attributes cost 3 HP per rank.
Hold Size
The most basic of the hold attributes, Size describes how big the actual structure of the hold is and serves as a prerequisite for any qualities that take up lots of space. In the terms of Ice and Iron, Hold Size means the size of the key building, typically the Rúnling Meadhall or the Fadein Broch. This building is the one all the rest of the hold revolves around, and any other structures exist only to provide the primary building with storage, services, and other such extras and as such count as part of the Grounds not the Size. Hold size also determines the Capacity for additional Qualities related to the inside of the Hold.

Hold Security
Security is the second most important hold attribute for a hold, determining the Difficulty Rating (2x the hold’s Security ranks) for any attempts to break in or for any other uses of the Security skill on the premises. Hold Security also measures how defensible a hold is, and determines its Condition. In addition Security is a prerequisite for qualities that add or change to the hold’s defensibility. A Hold cannot have a Hold Security higher than its Hold Grounds.

Hold Grounds
While Hold Size determines how large the main structure of the Hold is, Hold Grounds determines how much space there is around it, yet contained within the effects of its Hold Security. Grounds related Qualities typically take the form of additional buildings that reside therein within this zone. Hold Grounds is independent of the Hold Size, however it does determine the maximum for Hold Security.

Hold Location
Location describes how secluded the hold is from the rest of civilization. Being very distant can be advantageous for remaining undiscovered, although it also makes it more difficult to maintain Luxuries. This does not affect Hold Security, since strategic location is built into that concept directly.

Hold Luxury
The final Hold attribute is Luxury. In Ice and Iron, this is primarily a show of power and wealth, but can sometimes have in game effects as well. For instance, having a high Hold Luxury reduces the chance of disease spreading through the Hold. It can also reduce the cost of certain goods due to being able to have certain craftspeople on retainer directly. Most of the Qualities later in this section take this form. Also note that the cost of both the Hold Luxury attribute and the Luxury Qualities have costs modified by the Hold Location attribute.

4
Servants, occasional exotic spices or material goods, regular access to medical care, clean water, high quality food and clothing
5
Extravagant wealth in the form of the finest food, art, and crafted goods available, and considerable amounts of hard currency, clean water, spices, primitive sewage, regular entertainment, the peak of available comfort

Hold Qualities
Now that we have defined what makes a base in the most general terms, it is time to start adding extras that give certain bonuses, either to skills use such as crafting stations or libraries, or possibly to a character’s personal warband (see the mass combat rules further on for more information on that). Each quality costs 1 HP and takes up from 1 to 3 points of Capacity, either internal (Hold Size) or external (Hold Grounds).
Security Qualities
These qualities primarily increase the defensibility of a Hold, making it harder to penetrate with either force or subterfuge. All of these use Grounds Capacity, even though Guards applies to both.
Guards/Patrols
A guard presence is sure way to keep up security and ensure that the hold is protected from any threats. The hold guard force is distinct from the warband (even though they both ultimately draw from the same pool of warriors). Their numbers are usually drawn from the oldest and youngest among the warband. This Quality gives a bonus to Security equal to its Rank for every type of Hold Security roll. The Hold must be of at least Grounds 3 to take the Guards Quality. At GM discretion a Size 2 or larger hold can have a single guard for 1 point of capacity.
While the actual number of guards required to secure the hold is based on the Hold Grounds attribute, this Quality does come in 3 Ranks, depending on the man-power devoted to it (sparse, regular, or heavy patrols). This Quality can be raised temporarily by allocating members of the warband (at the GM’s discretion, if you are using the mass combat and kingdom rules below), but this does temporarily reduce the size of the warband.

Watchtowers
Watchtowers give a wide view of the surrounding countryside, and are primarily used to spot enemies from a distance. A hold can have a maximum of 2 watchtowers (not including free ones gained from the Wall quality) and must have at least Hold Grounds 3 and Hold Security 3. Each tower gives a +1 bonus to Hold Security for the direction it faces. In other words, the North Tower would give a +1 on any Security rolls related to detecting dangers coming from the north, but would do nothing for any threats coming from another direction.
Watchtowers for wooden palisades are essentially raised wooden platforms. Only the most heavily fortified holds (Hold Grounds 4-5, Wall 3) would have stone towers. These towers are too narrow to give an advantage to attack actions and to tall to give any advantage to defensive actions. They are purely a source of early detection.
Wall
The Wall quality either upgrades the existing wall of the hold or puts up a wall (more of a fence, really) around a hold that does not otherwise have a wall. This quality gives a bonus to security equal to its rank for every type of Hold Security roll. This quality comes in three ranks, although a Hold with grounds less than 3 can only get the first rank.
Hold Grounds Qualities
The following qualities involve the grounds of the keep, also referred to as the bailey. Each of these structures adds a unique ability or new avenue for specializing the hold.
Armory
An armory is essentially a storage area for the weapons and armor of the warband. Within each Armory building is the storage capacity for the gear of 75 warriors, along with the tools and materials to upkeep the said gear. Having enough armory space for all the warriors in a hold grants a +1 bonus to the Attack and Defense attributes of the warband (see the Mass Combat section for more details).
Barracks
Barracks are the living quarters of the warband, typically consisting of a cot, storage chest, and set of blankets for each man as well as a few tables and chairs to facilitate games and other camaraderie. While most warbands eat in the main hall or keep, in larger holds this is not possible and so this space is also used for eating. Each barracks building holds 50 warriors in comfort but can be made to hold twice that number in times of emergency. In those cases the warband takes a penalty of -1 to Morale. Barracks take up 15 capacity.
Workshop
A workshop is a place for a skilled worker to practice their art specifically for their patron (the owner of the hold). These can also be used by members of the troop with crafting skill. The most common are blacksmiths and armorers who upkeep the weapons, armor, and tools of the hold, but herbalists who can mix up medicines and the like are also popular. That said, a hold can have any number of workshops, each dedicated to any craft skill and this skill can be reassigned at a later date, although it can only be dedicated to a single craft skill at a time. A workshop grants a +1 on relevant craft skills made in the hold while also reducing the price of any new commissioned work (armor, weapons, etc) to the price of the materials needed. A workshop takes 5 Capacity.
Stables
Stables provide home and care for the horses of not only the warband but the owners of the hold and any other staff on hand, couriers, and also the horses of any guests. A small stable (capacity 5) can comfortably hold 6 horses and can hold as many as ten for short periods. A large stable (capacity 20) can hold 24 horses or 40 in an emergency. This also includes storage for tack, gear, and feed. A warband can have mounted warriors equal to half the total stable capacity of the hold.

For an extra 2 HP per building the barracks can be made the second story of the stables, those combining the two buildings for the same capacity cost (15), however the feed must be stored in its own Food Storage building. For holds smaller than Hold Grounds 3 the size and capacity of the stables are halved.

Food Storage
Every hold, from the peasant’s roundhouse to the High King’s impenetrable fort, has some amount of food storage, where root vegetables, grains, preserved meats, and other foodstuffs are laid back for winter and the like. For holds with more than just a few residents external storage is a necessity. To simplify all of the many types of food storage needed, consider each storage building as consisting of all the necessary environments and precautions to store whatever food is necessary. Typically this consists primarily of grains and dairy products like cheese and butter, but also dried fruits, vegetables, and meats, and even a cellar to store root vegetables and barrels of alcoholic beverages in.

Fresh Water
A huge benefit for any hold, especially those that may be placed under siege for any amount of time. A source of fresh water doubles the intervals between Siege rolls. It also grants a +1 to rolls against disease.
