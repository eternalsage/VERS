Mass Combat
While there is plenty of action and adventure to be had simply wandering around and dealing with the day to day dangers of Menskyrfold, all around the map there are wars raging for one reason or another. For those who are interested in getting involved in a bit of old school warfare, the following outlines the basics of mass combat.
In Ice and Iron most battles take place between two clans, frequently only involving their warbands and not even getting into mercenaries or conscriptions. Two minor clans likely only bring 20 to 30 warriors to bear in any conflict, with most battles being fought over hold boundaries, grazing rights, or some other slight, imagined or not. In these cases, the standard combat rules are more than sufficient. It’s only when major clans get involved, drawing upon the service of multiple minor clans that real warfare happens.
Leadership
While it is true that no war is one by the general sitting in comfort at home, without the strategy of gifted commanders even the most gifted warriors would just be an unruly mob. Because a roleplaying game is ultimately about the player characters and their trials and tribulations, each player should be made the commander of their own unit (more on units below). As leaders of a unit of warriors, player characters are empowered to make choices that will impact the battle as a whole while still able to stay in character and have a personal feel.
An army has a single senior commander, usually the Jarl, or the High King if the war is a big enough deal for him to be involved. The senior commander sets the overall strategy for the battle, and makes the decisions about what units to engage and a general idea of how to move towards victory. Typically a warband consists of 40 to 80 trained men, while conscripted farmers are usually grouped 60 to 100 deep. Each of these groups has a single commander, often the Thane of a minor clan or the Jarl’s Captain. This commander is responsible for enacting the senior commander’s orders, holding his unit together, and dealing with the moment to moment situations that can’t wait for specific orders.
Units
A Unit is a generic name for one of the aforementioned groupings of combatants. It is treated as a character in its own right, and even progresses and can
