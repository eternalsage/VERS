A (slightly) more realistic (and thus more complicated) combat, this adds an additional uncertainty to combat, making some attacks do greater damage (EV) while many will do less. This is done most easily by swapping out one of the dice for one of a different color. Compare the  result on that die to the below table to find out where your attack hits (or where the opponent's attack hits you). If you do not have a die of a second color, you can designate one of the dice as the location die and roll it to one side, or you can roll a totally separate die for this.

If the player wants to purposely try to hit a location, they will take the penalties in the location column. It is important to note that this subsystem would negate the Stunt "Target Location," because that is all handled in this way. The damage column give a multiplier for the EV. This is applied ***before*** compared to the target's RV to determine the actual EV. The final column suggests some additional conditions that more localized damage could cause.
 
In addition to the roleplay benefit of knowing where an attack lands, attack locations also affect the EV of the attack based on how essential or vulnerable the location is. For example, a Sniper Rifle with a EV of 14 that strikes the targetâ€™s leg only does EV 7 (before RV). If the same shot had instead hit the head then it would have instead had a EV of 21 which would be an almost guaranteed kill for all but the most resilient heroes.

This optional rule is best suited for very gritty game or one in which much more variability is desired in the damage done in physical combat.
