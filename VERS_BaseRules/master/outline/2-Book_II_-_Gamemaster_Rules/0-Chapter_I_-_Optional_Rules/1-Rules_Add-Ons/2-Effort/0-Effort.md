Heroes are the ones who make things happen when everything is impossible and all hope is lost. This deep-seated drive to push beyond the boundaries in the face of adversity is referred to in VERS as Effort points. Effort points are unique to player characters (the heroes), who get a number equal to their Resolve plus Composure, called their Effort Reserve. During the game characters can call on this Effort Reserve to perform tasks that are beyond the ability of even the most talent normal humans.

The primary use of Effort is to give a character a +2 bonus on a roll. To gain this benefit, simply declare the desire, spend the point, and roll the dice. Characters may spend Effort Points either before the roll or after the roll but not after the GM has assigned penalties and the outcome is known. Other uses for Effort include gaining +1 to an EV or EV, stabilizing while dying, or moving to the top of the Initiative order for one Turn.

A character can only spend one effort per Turn. Characters gain back Effort back at the beginning of every episode.
