Sometimes characters have wide-ranging abilities that fall outside the confines of a single concept, being instead tied more to a theme or elemental type, such as a superhero with control over ice. They can do anything they can imagine with said ice abilities, but only if the effect is ice related. For instance, said character could project icy projectiles at foes, create ice armor, make slippery sheets of ice, reduce the temperature of an area, encase a foe in ice, and plenty of other things. It would be prohibitively expensive to purchase all of these abilities individually, especially since many of these abilities would be one time uses.

In order to allow for such flexibility, the GM may allow the characters to take ranks in an Ability Theme. An ability theme is, in its simplest form, a pool of ranks that can be assigned to any ability on the fly as long as the end result fits within the purview of the theme. For instance, a character with ice powers could not construct a shield ability that was defined as a physical shield made out of wood from a museum, or an electromagnetic field, but they could create a wall of ice that would otherwise have the same effect.

Using a duration ability (like a form change or an inherent ability) would mean those ranks were “in use” and so couldn’t be used for other effects. This means that the player has to choose how much they want to delegate to a certain effect, because while more power means more effect, it also means less flexibility.

Because the ability theme doesn’t have ranks as a normal ability would, the character must also purchase a special Skill to use as the activation roll for those abilities that would need it. If a character makes an ability that has more ranks than the character has ranks in the ability theme skill then the character takes a penalty to the activation roll equal to the difference between the two. Likewise if the ranks of the ability are less than the skill then the character gets a bonus on the activation equal to the difference.

An ability theme costs 5 CP per rank in the pool. The Ability Theme skill costs 1 CP per rank as normal for a skill.
