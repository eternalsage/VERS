Ability Points are a method of restricting ability use particularly useful for certain fantasy sub-genres. In their essence, Ability Points represent a pool of energy that a character pulls from to use their abilities, such as their Life Force, Mana, or similar. This is most often tied to magic, but can also be applied to psychic powers, or even super powers, depending on the mood and theme of the setting.

A character restricted by Ability Points (AP) must make two choices (these choices are often dictated by the setting, consult the GM). The first choice is the source of the AP. This will determine how the character regains spent points as well as provide in-game flavor for the character and their abilities. Common choices are Spiritual energy, obtained by prayer or meditation, primarily used by priests and healers, and Arcane energy which is often obtained through study or perhaps through proximity to mystical artifacts or places, primarily used by wizards and sorcerers. Other common sources would be Chi or Life Force, a mystical energy that flows through the body’s mystical Chakra points, obtained by meditation or yoga,  and Mana, an elemental power derived from the power of the land itself, obtained through communing with nature. Even this list is not exhaustive, and nearly anything can be a source of AP, so long as it also has a method by which those points can also be regenerated.

The second choice is which attribute will the AP be tied to. In most settings that feature ability points this the setting will determine this. The choice of attribute typically colors the use and perception of those abilities, with Logic being more often used for abilities that require long study and deep knowledge, while abilities that are associated with perceptions and deceptions are better represented by Intuition. Resolve most often represents a will to alter or effect the world. Stamina is typically used for abilities based on physical prowess or considered fatiguing to use, while Presence or Charisma are common choices for abilities that rely primarily on a character’s force of personality. Just remember that the attribute chosen is for all of a character’s abilities, and so should fit the majority of the character’s abilities. It is, in essence, the method by which the character accesses the mystical energy reserves gathered from their power source and channels into the ability effect.

Depending on how easy the AP are to recover (Is the source readily available? Is it extremely rare?) the character has a number of AP equal to a multiple of their chosen attribute (see the chart below). These points return at a rate of 1 per minute when in the presence of their power source. To use an ability, the character must pay an AP. The character must pay this AP before making any rolls, and if it cannot be paid, the ability cannot be used. Extremely powerful abilities may cost 2 ability points at GM discretion. A character can spend as many AP on a turn as they wish, so long as they have them, and enough phases to use them all.
