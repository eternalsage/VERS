A characterâ€™s Potency represents how strong they are with magic, determining the strength of their effects as well as any other aspect of magic related to pure power. From the strength of their will to their ferocity when ripping the secrets from the universe, characters with a high Force are among the most powerful magic users in the setting, their minds containing the power of gods. Force would be added to all EVs and EVs similarly to how Strength is added to physical damage.
