A character’s Resonance is a measure of her capacity to shrug off magical effects. By realigning her being with the new possibilities of an enemy’s magic, she resonates on the same frequency, thus being unharmed as opposed to dissonant and being disrupted. Character’s specializing in Resonance may not produce the fanciest of effects or unravel her enemy’s spells with ease, but she can withstand the ever-altering landscape of a magical battle, her soul moving in unison with her, bending like a willow in the win. Resonance replaces Stamina in withstanding an enemy’s spells. If the setting is also using ability points (see above), Resonance also determines a character’s ability points.
