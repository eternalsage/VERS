If Potency represents the sheer power of a characterâ€™s magical ability, then Control relates the subtly of their magic and how deftly they weave their spells. Subtle practice and close examination of their enemies grants them a wisdom that allows them to strike deep into fragile weaknesses without unduly stressing themselves. What they may lack in direct firepower they make up for in clever planning and cunning execution that can easily leave those focused more on power in the dust. Control replaces Agility in any attack rolls using magic, as well as used in any Defense rolls made to avoid magical effects.
