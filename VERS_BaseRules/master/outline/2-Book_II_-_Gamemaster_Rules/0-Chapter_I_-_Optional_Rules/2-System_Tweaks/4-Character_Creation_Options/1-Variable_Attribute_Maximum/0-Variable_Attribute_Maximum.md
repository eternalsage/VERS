Normally, the maximum attribute rank for all non super-heroic level characters is 5. With this option, maximum ranks would differ by attribute depending on species. For example, perhaps Elves would have a maximum Agility of 6, while an Orc might have a maximum Stamina of 6. For balance, pair each increase in attribute maximum with a corresponding decrease in another attribute. To continue the previous examples, Elves may take a penalty to Stamina, making their maximum 4, representing a graceful fragility, while the Orc may take a penalty to Composure to represent physical endurance and short tempers that are common to the species. This option is good as a nod to species diversity without changing much about the basic rules of the system.
