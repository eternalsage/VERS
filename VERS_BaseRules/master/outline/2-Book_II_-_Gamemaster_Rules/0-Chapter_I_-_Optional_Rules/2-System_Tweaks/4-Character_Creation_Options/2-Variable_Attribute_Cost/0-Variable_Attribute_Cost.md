Another way to invoke a similar situation is to alter the costs of the attributes in question based on the species. This would represent not the ultimate capability of a species in a certain area, but instead how hard they may have to work to better themselves. As before, temper any bonuses with an equal number of penalties. Using the same examples as above, Elves may only pay 2 CP for ranks of Agility, while having to pay 4 CP for ranks in Stamina. Similarly the Orc would pay 2 CP for Stamina and 4 CP for Composure. As a special note, it is a bad idea to change the costs of an attribute by more than 1 point either way as things begin to get unbalanced.
