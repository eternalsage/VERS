In many ways, the best approach for different species groups is to combine the maximums and the costs both, based on species. In such a setup not only would the Elf have a maximum of 6 in Agility but Agility would also only cost 2 CP per rank, while have a maximum Stamina of 4 and paying 4 CP per rank for it. Similarly the Orc in this setup would have a maximum Stamina of 6 and would pay 2 CP per rank, and have a maximum Composure of 4 and pay 4 CP per rank. Not only do their inherent advantages increase their potential but they also find reaching that potential easier, while their inherent disadvantages limit their potential as well as make reaching that potential harder.
