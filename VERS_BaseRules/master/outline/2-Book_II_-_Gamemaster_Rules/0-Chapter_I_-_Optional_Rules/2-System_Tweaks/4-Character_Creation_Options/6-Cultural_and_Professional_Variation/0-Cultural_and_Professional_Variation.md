In the real world, part of our individual differences stem from our cultural background. There are certainly other factors, and cultural heritage may not even be the largest of them, but there is a body of evidence, both from studies and anecdotes, that suggests people cannot help but be shaped in some way by the environment they grow up in. People in the U.S. are different from people in Japan. People from the Southwestern U.S. are even a little different from people from the Northeast U.S., even if it is just in food preferences and predominate professional skills. Thereâ€™s no good reason to assume that things would be any different on/in fictional environments. If people from two different states can vary considerably in some of their attitudes and points of reference, why not people from two different fantasy kingdoms?

Unlike species and archetype methods, cultural variations only affect skills. Of course, not everyone who lives in San Francisco is a fisherman, nor is everyone in New York a taxi driver. To avoid mono-cultures and other stereotypical scenarios it is best to present Cultural and Professional packages as groups of skills that are typical for people from the area or in a certain profession. In this way, it provides a framework that players can use as a guide, but they can feel free to deviate to make their characters different and interesting.
