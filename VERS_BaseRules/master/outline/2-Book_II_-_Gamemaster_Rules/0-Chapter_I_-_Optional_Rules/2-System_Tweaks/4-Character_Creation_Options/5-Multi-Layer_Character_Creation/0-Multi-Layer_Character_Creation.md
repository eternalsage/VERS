It is also possible to combine all the above approaches. In such a system, a character would have a natural aptitude and weakness based on their species but also an individual faculty that makes them unique based on their overarching archetype. This can become troublesome in cases where the characterâ€™s species and archetype intersect. The GM can require characters to choose different attributes in these times of overlap, or they can allow the character to double up bonuses (or penalties). Allowing characters to double up on bonuses may be appropriate for settings that have the potential for characters like Beowulf or Heracles, but they can definitely unbalance a game. In these cases it is strongly advised for a GM to require a very detailed and setting appropriate back history that justify such a situation, such as being semi-divine, or something of the sort, and putting complications into any series plot that will play to the disadvantages of such a back story.
