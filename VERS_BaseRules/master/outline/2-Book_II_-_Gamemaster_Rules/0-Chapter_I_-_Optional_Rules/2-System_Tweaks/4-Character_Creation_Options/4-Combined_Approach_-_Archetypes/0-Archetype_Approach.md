For settings that do not include other species, or perhaps even for those that do, but wish to create even more diversity in characters, there is also the idea of archetypes. In its most basic form, the player decides what archetype the character fits best into. Based on that archetype the character then gets a bonus and a penalty as described above. The major difference is that this differentiation has nothing to do with species, but instead is just typical variation within a group of individuals.

The three archetypes and their corresponding attribute sets are:

**Power Characters:** Forceful both physically and mentally, these characters take a more heavy-handed approach to life. They are the hardest hitters, the most brilliant scholars, and the most moving public speakers. They are impressive and oftentimes downright overwhelming, but tend to lack subtlety. Characters of this archetype choose one Power attribute (Strength, Logic, or Presence) as their strength. Conversely, they must choose a Finesse attribute (Agility, Intuition, or Charisma) as their weakness.

**Finesse Characters:** Slick and subtle, the power behind the throne, the knife in the dark, the slick merchant or charming courtier. They get things done not by being the biggest guy on the block, but by knowing the ins and outs of the situation and how and when to exploit them to best advantage. Able to strike quickly and decisively when the moment is right, but you can only surprise a man once, and these individuals tend to prefer to withdraw rather than risk a protracted engagement. Characters of this archetype may choose one of the Finesse attributes (Agility, Intuition, or Charisma) as their strength. Conversely, they must choose one of the Resistance Attributes (Stamina, Resolve, or Composure) as their weakness.

**Endurance Characters:** Stoic and uncompromising, these characters prefer to take a steady and methodical approach to life. Like waves upon the shore, carrying away a little bit of sand every time they surge landward, characters built for endurance get ahead not with decisive blows or manipulating the circumstances, but by patiently wearing away othersâ€™ defenses and withstanding it all until no-one else is left. While being able to survive anything obviously has its virtues, it has its price as well; you cannot fight a defensive war and an offensive one at the same time, and characters of this type often have difficulty taking decisive, forceful action. Characters of this archetype may choose one of the Resistance attributes (Stamina, Resolve, or Composure) as their strength. Conversely, they must choose one of the Power Attributes (Strength, Logic, or Presence) as their weakness.
