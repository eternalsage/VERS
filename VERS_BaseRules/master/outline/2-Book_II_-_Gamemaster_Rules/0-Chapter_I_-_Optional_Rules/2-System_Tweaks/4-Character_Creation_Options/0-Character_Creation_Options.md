Everyone is different. Those differences can manifest differently in different settings, however. In the real world, there is only one baseline (human) and divergences are based primarily on where and how the person grew up and the experiences they gained on the way. The extra races in some fantasy or sci-fi settings create a special dilemma then: there, characters aren’t always human, and so they can’t always be expected to follow that same baseline. There is not a single, simple way of representing this kind of complexity, so for those that don’t care about how human potential differs from Elven potential, it might be best to just leave these rules out. However, presented below are a few possible ways of getting at the inherent diversity of life found in multi-species settings.
