Focus is the attribute that describes a character’s ability to keep their attention on the task at hand. Mental attacks such as distractions, surprises, puzzles, and some magical effects damage Focus, while it heals through time, meditation, or rest. On the character sheet Focus takes the form of a Focus tracker made up of a number of boxes equal to the character’s total Focus. When the character takes Focus damage, mark a number of boxes equal to the total damage taken on the Focus tracker with an X. Mark these left to right (and top to bottom if enough of them exist to have multiple rows), and erase in the opposite direction when healed.

When marking the last point of Focus a character becomes dazed, confused, or shaken (as dramatically appropriate) and takes a -4 penalty cumulative to any other penalties to all other rolls. In addition, a character with a full Focus tracker must make a Discipline roll to perform any action that might require concentration. In game this manifests as the character becoming easily manipulated or tricked, willing to tell secrets, give away important items, or believe gross fabrications in line with the origin of their confusion. For every hour that passes with a full Focus tracker the character must also make a Discipline roll against losing a point of Morale.

Focus also determines how many ongoing advantages or other abilities a character can sustain at one time. She can manage a number of active effects equal to her remaining Focus (not the maximum). This means that when a character takes Focus damage they are less able to maintain the concentration needed to sustain those abilities and can only do so at a reduced capacity until they take some time to gather their Focus again.

Focus naturally heals back over time at a rate of 1 point per 15 minutes, although quiet, calm, or peaceful environments can halve that recovery time. Characters must remove, defeat, evade, or otherwise deal with all sources of Focus damage before Focus can naturally heal. In the case of Focus damage due to environment Focus can only be regained through Meditation, special advantages or abilities, or sleep.

Certain situations can actually increase a character’s Focus above the maximum temporarily. This state is called Focused, which allows the character to grant themselves a bonus on rolls equal to the overage. The overage does not have to be used all at the same time but can be spread out over multiple turns, one roll per turn. Just remember, any Focus damage will also take away this bonus and the Focus overage fades at the same 1 point per 15 minutes.

Starting Focus is equal to twice the character’s Resolve attribute plus any applicable health bonus (see the GM section for more information about tone and health bonuses), and has a minimum of 1.
