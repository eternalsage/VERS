Condition is a measure of how intact an object is, tracking the damage dealt to an object from attacks or other sources. Like the other health attributes, it is represented on the sheet as a Condition tracker, and its damage is marked in X. Condition does not heal back naturally, and can only be healed by successful application of a related Engineering, Art, or Profession skill, often requiring additional materials. Some items cannot be repaired at all. Any damage dealt to an object also impairs its function, with the item taking a -1 penalty when reaching three-quarters of its overall Condition, -2 at a half, and a -4 at one-quarter. An object is broken when Condition reaches 0.

Determine an object’s Condition by adding the object’s Size and Hardness. If an object is solid (no moving parts) then double this value, if its mechanical then halve it, and if it’s delicate then quarter it to get an object’s total starting Condition.
