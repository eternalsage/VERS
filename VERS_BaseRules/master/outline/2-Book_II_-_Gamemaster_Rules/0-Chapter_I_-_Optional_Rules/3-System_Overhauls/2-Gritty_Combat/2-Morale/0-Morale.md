Morale is the attribute that describes a character’s ability to keep their cool under pressure. Social attacks like intimidation, frightening or tragic events, or loneliness damage Morale, while it heals though time, camaraderie, and rousing speeches. On the character sheet Morale takes the form of a Morale tracker made up of a number of boxes equal to the character’s total Morale. When the character takes Morale damage mark a number of boxes equal to the total damage taken on the Morale tracker with an X. Mark these left to right (and top to bottom if enough of them exist to have multiple rows), and erase in the opposite direction when healed.

When marking the last box of the Morale tracker a character becomes paralyzed by fear, apathy, or sadness (as dramatically appropriate) and takes a -4 penalty cumulative to any other penalties to all other rolls. In addition, a character with a full Focus tracker must make a Discipline roll to perform any action that that involve the sources (real or perceived) of these negative emotions. In game this manifests as the character becoming easily manipulated, quickly obeying direct orders in line with their fears, depression, or apathy. For every hour that passes with a full Morale tracker the character must also make a Discipline roll against losing a point of Focus.

Morale naturally heals back over time at a rate of 1 point per 15 minutes, although food, friendship, and/or rest can halve that recovery time. Characters must remove, defeat, evade, or otherwise deal with all sources of Morale damage before Morale can naturally heal. In the case of Morale damage due to the environment (traveling a devastated wasteland, having nothing to eat or drink, no shelter, etc), Morale can only be regained through advantages, abilities, or through sleep.

Certain situations can actually increase a character’s Morale above the maximum temporarily. This state is called Inspired, which allows the character to grant themselves a bonus on rolls equal to the overage. The overage does not have to be used all at the same time but can be spread out over multiple turns, one roll per turn. Just remember, any Morale damage will also take away this bonus and the Morale overage fades at the same 1 point per 15 minutes.

Starting Morale is equal to twice the character’s Composure attribute plus any applicable health bonus (see the GM section for more information about tone and health bonuses), and has a minimum of 1.
