Vitality is the attribute that describes a character’s ability to take physical damage and continue on. Physical attacks like punches, kicks, gunshots, or stab wounds damage Vitality, while it heals through time, the First Aid skill, or advantages. Unlike Focus and Morale, Vitality comes in two types: lethal for cuts, stabs, and other deadly wounds and non-lethal for bruises and breaks.

On the character sheet Vitality takes the form of a Vitality tracker made up of a number of boxes equal to the character’s total Vitality. When the character takes non-lethal Vitality damage mark a number of boxes equal to the total damage taken with a slash. Mark these left to right (and top to bottom if enough of them exist to have multiple rows). If there are not enough empty boxes then upgrade non-lethal boxes to lethal damage (marked with an X). This upgrade upgrade also happens from leftmost to right starting with the first box with no lethal damage marked until all the damage has been marked. Lethal damage starts as an X, and it upgrades non-lethal damage first before spreading into unmarked boxes. Erase boxes right to left when healing.

When marking the last point of either type of Vitality the character becomes disabled and takes a -4 penalty to all rolls cumulative to any other penalties from full Morale and/or Focus trackers. In fact, he must also make a Discipline roll to even act at all. In addition every turn in this state the character also takes a single point of unresisted damage to both Focus and Morale as he sinks into desperation. When all of his Health trackers are full then he is either unconscious (if the last physical attack was non-lethal) or dead (if it was lethal).

Vitality naturally heals back over time at a rate of 1 point per day for lethal wounds, or 1 point every hour for non-lethal damage. Applications of the First Aid skill can reduce those times by half. A character must heal all non-lethal damage before the character can begin healing lethal damage.

Certain situations can actually increase a character’s Vitality above the maximum temporarily. This state is called Invigorated, which allows the character to grant themselves a bonus on rolls equal to the overage. The overage does not have to be used all at the same time but can be spread out over multiple turns, one roll per turn. Just remember, any Vitality damage will also take away this bonus and the Vitality overage fades at the same 1 point per hour as non-lethal damage. Also, unlike Focused and Inspired, the bonus from Invigorated can only be used on physical actions.

Starting Vitality is equal to the character’s Size + twice the character’s Stamina plus any applicable health bonus (see the GM section for more information about tone and health bonuses).
