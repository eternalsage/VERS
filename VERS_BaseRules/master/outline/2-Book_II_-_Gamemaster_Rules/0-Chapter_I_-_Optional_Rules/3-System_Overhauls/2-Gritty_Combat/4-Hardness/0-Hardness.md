Hardness is a measure of how well an object resists being deformed, broken, or destroyed. Hardness is primarily based on the material used in its construction, but can also be based on the construction method and the amount of reinforcement, if appropriate. Hardness is not something that every object needs. As a general rule, pick the highest Hardness rating for a composite material (i.e. walls, cars, etc). When trying to break things, Hardness is the inanimate equivalent of Protection. See the Combat section for more information.
