3d6 replaced by D20 roll. Attributes and Skill ranks convert to dice (1=1d2, 2=1d4, 3=1d6, 4=1d8, 5=1d10, 6=1d12). DR are doubled and added to 10 to convert. Passive Rolls look like 1d20+Attribute Die+Skill Die+-Mods vs DC, Active Rolls look like 1d20+Attribute Die+Skill Die+-Mods vs 10+Double CT. Damage is HP, FP, and MP, and is = to 10 x Res Attr, damage is determined using the same dice conversions as above. Damage above 6 = (7=1d6+1d8, 8=2d8, 9=3d6, 10=2d10, 11=1d6+2d8, 12=2d12, etc)
