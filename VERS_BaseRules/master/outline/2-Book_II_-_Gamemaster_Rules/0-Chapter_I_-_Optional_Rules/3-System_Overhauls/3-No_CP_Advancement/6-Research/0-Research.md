Training under a master (or at least someone more skilled than you) is the easy way to earn skill Ups outside the field. Sometimes you have to figure things out on your own, through books or even self devised experiments. While not technically more difficult, it does take more time: 900 hours per point of experience, or roughly 16 weeks, 8 hours a day. The upshot to this is that you do not have to rely on someone elseâ€™s schedule to fit in your learning. The only limit to how long you can spend at research at a time is equal to your ranks in Resolve + Stamina in hours. After this time you must take a break for at least two hours before beginning again. This does not count in a required amount of sleep, however. The character can go on for as long as they can make their Discipline check to stay awake.
