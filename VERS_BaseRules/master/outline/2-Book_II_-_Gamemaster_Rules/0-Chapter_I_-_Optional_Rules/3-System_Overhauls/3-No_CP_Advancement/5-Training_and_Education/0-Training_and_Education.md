Education and Training are basically two names for the same thing, although Education tends to have a more Academic connotation while Training tends to be thought of as more Physical. Either way they involve another, more skilled, character helping the less skilled character learn and understand the nuances of a skill. Because this takes place in a safe environment this method of leveling a skill is more time intensive than the standard “learning in the field” method represented above. It is, however, a better way to learn some skills like Specialty skills that don’t see much use while adventuring.

The amount of time it takes to learn an amount equivalent to a new point of experience by Training or Education is roughly 600 hours (approximately 8 college credits). By these rules, a character can go from 0 to 1 in a skill in roughly the time it takes to get an Associates Degree, 0 to 2 during a typical Bachelor’s Degree, and 0 to 3 by the end of the Doctorate which is just about right for what these skill ranks mean “in the real world.” And with the way that most Universities (at least here in the States) pad out degree programs with General Education requirements, getting 3 ranks in the “Majored in” skill will likely put at least 1 rank in a couple of others.

A character can only be trained in a skill by someone with at least 2 more ranks than the character’s current rank. This means even the greatest master of the skill can only show you so much. The rest you must learn on your own, one way or another. A character can also use training to work directly on their attributes (such as a workout regimen for a physical attribute, or taking a public speaking class to better Presence).
