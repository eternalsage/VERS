While raising skills is fairly easy, raising attributes is much more difficult. Whenever a character makes a Difficult roll, they may declare that this roll is for the root attribute and not the skill. In the case of rolls like Discipline and Dodge, the character must choose which attribute will receive the experience (as there are no skills involved). A character gets an attribute Up when they have made a number of rolls equal to the next rank in that attribute (minimum 1).
