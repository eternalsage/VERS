Each skill and attribute have a series of small circles next to them. This is the experience log. Once you make a roll that qualifies for a certain type (M for moderate, C for challenging, and D for difficult) you would mark it there. It's not necessary to fill in the circles, just a slash through them is fine. Once you have what you need for skill Up (M and C each equal to the next rank and D equal to half that amount, round up) or attribute Up (D equal to the next rank) then the skill or attribute go up. Right there. In the middle of a fire-fight or where ever you may be, no matter what else you might be doing. Then you simply erase the marks and start counting toward your new goals. Remember that you only count skills used in combat (social, mental, or physical) once per the entire combat.
