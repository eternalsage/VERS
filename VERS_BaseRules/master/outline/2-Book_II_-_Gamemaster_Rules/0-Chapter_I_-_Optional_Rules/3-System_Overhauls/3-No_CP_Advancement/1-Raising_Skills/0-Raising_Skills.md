To raise a skill’s rank (skill Up) the character must make a number of Easy or harder rolls and and a number of Moderate rolls equal to the next rank. In addition, the character must make a number of Difficult rolls equal to half the next rank (rounding up, with a minimum of 1). These experiences can trickle down, if for instance a character gets into a particular difficult situation and ends up with more Difficult rolls than she needs for the next skill Up, then she can start using those for her Challenging. This only works downwards, however, as no number of Moderate tasks will ever give the depth of understanding that even a Challenging task would bring, let alone a Difficult. Mundane uses of the skill do not count toward skill Up at all.
It is also important to mention that failures do count towards skill Ups (and other types of advancement, too). In fact, some would say you learn more from your failures than you do your successes, and this proves true here as well. If you collaborate with the GM to turn your failed roll into a more dramatic moment, such as declaring that “not only did you fail to unlock the door but you also made a noise that alerted a guard”, then you can mark two experiences for the roll. This is ultimately GM discretion, but it makes things more interesting.
Finally, skills like Perception or Blades typically get used multiple times in a row (combats, etc), whereas skills like Expertise: Particle Physics may only be used once or twice in an entire game. Only mark experience once for an entire combat (and yes it’s ok to mark the highest difficulty). Life and death experiences teach more than safe practice at home but not by the margin that would be typical if each sword swing counted as an experience.
