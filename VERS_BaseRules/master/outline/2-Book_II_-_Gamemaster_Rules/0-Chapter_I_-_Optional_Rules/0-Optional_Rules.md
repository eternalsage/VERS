Optional Rules add flexibility, flavor, and longevity to the system, allowing veteran GMs and Players more options during character creation, GMs more ways to evoke exactly the right mood or theme, and both the abilities to not get burnt out on the system by keeping it fresh but balanced. These rules are in the GM section for a reason, and are not intended for every game, check with the GM before using any of these.

The chapter separates these optional rules into three categories: Rules Add-Ons, System Tweaks, and System Overhauls. Rules add-ons are small additions for those who want more complexity, either to fit a particular theme for a setting or because they find it fun or interesting while system tweaks are larger and either change an existing subsystem in a small way or are more substantial additions that may have an impact on balance in the long run. System overhauls are alternate takes on fundamental building blocks of the system and will completely change the experience of the game.
