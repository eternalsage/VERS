The Scene is the smallest narrative section, and as such will be where most of the work will be done. A Scene is simply a collection of events that happen in a single location. As such, the Scene is where all the action is, as well as the context of that action.

When planning out Scenes, it can be important to decide what actions must occur in a certain order, and which things are order independent. In other words the heroes cannot question the henchmen until they have defeated them, which comes after bursting in on the henchmen extorting money from the shopkeeper. Calling for back up or noticing the unique weapon brandished by one of the things. however, could happen at any point in the Scene or maybe not at all.

Once the events are planed, all that really remains are descriptions of the surroundings setting up the environment to evoke the imaginations of the players. Avoid overly flowery words, concentrating more on short concise descriptions of a few individual elements, paying special attention to all of the players senses. For example, you could describe the heroes:

“Passing down a long alleyway dimly lit by the blinking death throes of a neon light, the smell of the recent rain is almost enough to cover the smell of the piles of garbage stacked against the graffiti covered walls. Between the small sounds of rodents and the distant sounds of thunder, you can hear what sounds like shouting ahead.”

The example is short and quick, but it sets the environment rather easily, drawing the players in and getting their imaginations going. The more immersed the players are, the more enjoyment they are going to get out of the game in general. A well laid out Scene not only tells a segment of the story, but it also creates that immersion.
