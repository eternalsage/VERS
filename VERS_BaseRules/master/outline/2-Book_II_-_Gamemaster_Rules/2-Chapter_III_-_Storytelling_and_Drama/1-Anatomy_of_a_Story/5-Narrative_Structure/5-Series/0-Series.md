A Series is a term that is mostly used in television and modern genre fiction, but most technically it simply refers to a collection works related by characters, plot, and conflict. Traditionally in tabletop games, this is referred to as a Campaign, which stems from the lineage of the style from war-themed strategy games. Regardless of how it is referred to, however, it still remains the overarching core story within which all smaller adventures occur.

The key thing to keep in mind when designing a new Series is what is the overall goal? Is there a major villain, such as a Dark Lord threatening the good people, or is the major conflict something more hidden and personal, such the main characterâ€™s being tied together in each new reincarnation by the mistakes of their past lives they must unravel? Whatever the source of the Series conflict, all of the smaller conflicts should revolve around this larger conflict and illuminate it.

This is not to say that every single Episode must be integral to the Series plot, nor that all things discovered in an Episode have to relate more to the Series than, say, the Season plot. Merely keep the overarching Series plot in mind when working on the smaller details. While individual Episodes may be more memorable overall, a well thought out Series will keep the players enthralled Episode after Episode.
