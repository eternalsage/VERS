When first trying to organize a new game, it is very important to think about inspiration. No story has ever been created in a vacuum; every author has been touched by the things around him, be they other stories or even just the people, places, and events around him.

Many RPGs are specifically targeted towards certain genres such as fantasy and sci-fi that define both the settings and the types of stories that are expected. Others have a broader stylistic inspiration, such as anime or action movie which doesn’t impart much information about the setting and story, but still gives a certain framework of tone and mood within which to work. There are also plenty of examples of stories that do not fit comfortably in any one style, but instead take lots of cues from different places, such as the “Firefly” series which combines elements of both westerns and sci-fi.

When planning a game, it is important to identify any influences and inspirations that may have an effect and learn about the conventions and tropes that make up those things. Not only will this let you hone in on the details to make the game familiar and comfortable for the players, but it will also give a better idea of where it would be possible to shake up the conventions and have things really stand out. Thinking long and hard about the inspiration will let the game take form easily and allow deviations that will enable the game to not seem like a carbon copy of some existing story.
