A character who takes an unexpected fall can expect injury as much if not more than one who gets hit with a sword. The base EV for fall damage is 2 per meter fallen. A falling character can attempt an Acrobatics roll to land safely with a -2 penalty on the roll per meter of uncontrolled fall. Each degree of success reduces the EV by 1. Conversely, a controlled fall (i.e. jumping) is somewhat safer, if only because the character has a better chance of landing in the best possible way. The base EV for a controlled fall is 1 point per meter, and the penalty on the Acrobatics roll is -1 per meter fallen. A character does get to apply their Stamina as a RV to the fall damage.
