Characters on any kind of extended journey run the risk of running out of food and drink. While it may seem trivial to our more modern, urban-centric thought processes, it is a real and present danger even in modern settings. There is a reason why many ancient cultures preferred exile to execution. The average person alone in the wilderness is a dead man just waiting for his grave.

While (often) easier to get, water is by far the more important of the two. A character can only go a number of days equal to 1 + the character’s Stamina (minimum 1 day) without water before feeling the effects of its lack. Thereafter, each day without water the character must make resistance rolls against all three types of damage (Focus, Injury, and Morale). This roll also takes into account any penalties from exposure or other environmental damage the character endures. Recoveries after being found and dehydration begun happen at half the normal rate as the body struggles to regain its chemical equilibrium.

Starvation, on the other hand, is easier to experience and also easier to survive. A character can survive without food nearly twice as long as she could without water, physically feeling no ill effects for a number of days equal to 1 + the character’s Stamina (minimum 1). After that time she must make a resistance roll against all three types of attacks every other day.

A Disabled character due to  thirst or hunger becomes lethargic and apathetic. A Disarrayed character due to thirst or hunger becomes confused, disoriented, and may even hallucinate. A Debilitated character due to thirst or hunger becomes irrational, emotional, and moody.
