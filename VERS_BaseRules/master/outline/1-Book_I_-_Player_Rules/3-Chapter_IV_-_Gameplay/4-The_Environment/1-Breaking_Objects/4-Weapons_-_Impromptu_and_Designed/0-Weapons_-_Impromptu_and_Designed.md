A character can use an object from the environment as an impromptu weapon, such as a wooden chair in a tavern brawl. The impromptu weapon has a base EV equal to half its Hardness plus its Size, with a minimum of 0. An impromptu weapon takes an equal amount of damage on a successful strike as the full EV dealt to the target before Protection, mitigated by its Hardness. Also note that such a weapon cannot do more damage in a single attack than it would take to reduce it to Broken condition, in which case the object breaks with the use.

Weapons and armor do not normally count as objects in terms of breakage rules, however GMs wishing for a grittier feel can have such equipment take a Durability condition for every day they are used but not cared for. Treat this as a roleplaying task, no roll required. The character mentioning they sharpen their blades and oil their chainmail before putting it away after a battle is sufficient.
