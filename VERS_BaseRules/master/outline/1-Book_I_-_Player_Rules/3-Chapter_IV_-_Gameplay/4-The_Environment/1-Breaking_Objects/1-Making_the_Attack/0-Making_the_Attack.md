First, targeting an inanimate object sitting on it own without an NPC nearby (such as trying to shoot an apple on a ledge) is always a passive roll. The difficulty rating for the attack roll is equal to (-1 x size) + range penalty (if any). If the object has a shape that makes it particularly hard to hit or is at a strange angle that belies it true size it may give additional penalties. Examples would include a sewer grate (more likely to shoot through the metal than to hit it). If the object is held in the hands of an NPC, such as trying to shoot a gun out of someone's hand, then it is an active roll using the NPCs defense.
