When damage occurs to inanimate objects, the following rules outline process of resolving it. However, remember it is not always necessary to determine the full effects of such interactions as they add unnecessary complexity for very little dramatic gain and will grind any game to a standstill if the attempt is made to calculate the damage for every single item the troop interacts with. Used judiciously, however, object damage can add a little extra zing to any encounter.
