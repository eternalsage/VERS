Once the attack is ruled a success and the NDV is determined, the only thing remaining is to apply the appropriate condition. Objects take Durability conditions, which are, in order of least to greatest: Worn, Damaged, Tattered, and Broken.

- **Worn:** The Worn condition applies if the NDV is between 0 and 2. These are small nicks, fraying, or other such small damage. This can be seen but does not imped the item's function. Regardless of the tone of a game, an object can have up to 3 of these before they start being upgraded.

- **Damaged:** The Damaged condition applies when the NDV is between 3-5. Knicks, cracks, rust, holes; these are the signs of the Damaged condition. Regardless of tone an item can have 2 of these before they begin upgrading to the next level. Uses of the item take a -1 penalty to all rolls per condition at this level.

- **Tattered:** The Tattered condition applies when the NDV is between 6 & 8. A tattered item is so damaged it is barely holding together, with large gashes, missing chunks, or other major signs of damage. Because of the poor condition any use of the item takes an additional -2 penalty. Object can only have one Tattered condition.

- **Broken:** This condition applies when the NDV is greater than 9. A broken item no longer functions, but is in total disrepair. Any function that the object once had is lost, and if that function was structural then it crumbles, possibly with disastrous results. 

Objects do not get recoveries as characters do. The only way for an object to remove Durability conditions is for a character to use an appropriate Craft, Profession, or Art skill to make repairs.
