Beyond Size, objects only have one other attribute, and that is their Hardness. This is a very abstract measurement of how hard it is to destroy an object. It is used similarly to the resistance attributes (Composure, Resolve, or Stamina) when figuring out damage, in that the EV of the incoming attack is compared against it to determine the NDV. See the chart below for examples.

When damaging an object, it is important to remember that there are more factors than just the toughness of the material to consider. Thickness is the major concern. The chart considers these materials at a thickness of 3 cm (roughly 1 inch), which is the equivalent of -6 ranks of distance. The Hardness is increased by 1 for each additional rank of thickness.

The other major consideration is the complexity of the item. Solid slabs of material are much harder to break than objects made up of moving parts like gears, or which are holding softer materials inside. Complex items take a -2 penalty, and compound materials take the average of the top three materials involved in their construction.
