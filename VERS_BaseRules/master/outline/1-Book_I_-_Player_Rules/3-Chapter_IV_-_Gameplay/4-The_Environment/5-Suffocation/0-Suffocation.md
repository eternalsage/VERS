Outside of combat and doing minimal physical activity, a character can hold his breath for a number of minutes equal to half of their Stamina. After this period of time, the character must make Discipline rolls every turn, with a cumulative penalty of -1 per turn. If the Discipline roll fails then the character takes Focus damage, the EV equal to the current penalty. When a character becomes Disarrayed their autonomous body functions kick in and they begin trying to draw in air. At this point they must make a resistance roll against Injury, with an EV equal to the number of Turns since becoming Disarrayed. Upon becoming Disabled they have drowned or suffocated. If the character was merely trying to avoid nerve gas or the like, then they may not take Injury damage, but they will suffer the effects of whatever they were trying to avoid.

Suffocation in combat is a little different. Due to the stresses and activities of fighting off an attacker while also trying to retain oxygen, a character in combat may hold their breath for 1 turn per point of Stamina with no complications. After this period of time they begin to lose Focus as outlined above.
