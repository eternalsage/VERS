Poison is a special type of chemical that damages internal tissues while typically not affecting skin or equipment. Many poisons can make the character blind, suffocate, and similar effects, while other poisons have more esoteric effects like hallucinations, reduced attributes, and more.

There are four main Vectors for poisoning: contact, inhaled, ingested, or injected. Most poisons only have one vector, but it may have more than one vector, or even work on all vectors, depending on the type.

Contact poisons are rare, and usually come in the form of toxic materials like mercury, and are almost always accumulation poisons (see below). Inhaled poisons enter the body through the lungs, and often target the respiratory and circulatory systems. Ingested poisons enter through the stomach and tend to target the endocrine system, especially the liver and kidneys. Finally injected poisons enter through the bloodstream like snake and spider venom, which often targets the nervous system. Of course these are all just typical examples, and many of the most famous poisons like cyanide function by disrupting specific molecular reactions the body needs to survive instead of targeting specific organ systems.

It is said that everything is poison, and there is poison in everything. The only question is the Dose. Each poison must specify a time which is the maximum length between doses. If the poisoner administers another dose within that time then it counts toward the overall effect. If the next dose is not administered in time then the body has processed enough of the original dose for it to no longer be a danger and the process has to start again from the beginning.

Finally, like a chemical, poison has a Potency (weak, moderate, and strong) which determines how powerful the poison is and how hard it is to resist. The EV of a poison is equal to the severity (2 for weak, 4 for moderate, and 6 for strong) plus the number of doses accumulated. Each time a victim takes a dose of poison, she must make a resistance roll with the new penalty. Poisons use the same status effects as the Afflict ability effect, although some types of poison may used Injury conditions, depending on design and purpose.
