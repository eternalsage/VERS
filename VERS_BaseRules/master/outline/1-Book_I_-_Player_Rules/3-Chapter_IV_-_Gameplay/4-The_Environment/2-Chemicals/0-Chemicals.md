To keep things simple, all Chemicals have two attributes: Concentration and Potency. The concentration of the chemical determines the time it takes for the chemical to do damage, with properly mixed chemicals that the average person would have contact with being so weak as to require hours before doing appreciable harm. Potency, on the other hand, determines how much damage that damage actually is.

The chemical deals damage at the end of every time interval prescribed by the concentration until the chemical is removed in some manner. In addition the damage is cumulative, with each application adding to the overall EV, making even weak, dilute chemicals deadly over an extended period of time.

Chemicals apply at full potency to all materials they touch, however porous materials like cloth also allow some of the chemical to seep through and affect lower layers. Seeping chemicals take a -1 penalty to potency per layer they seep through.

In addition, any strong potency chemical releases noxious fumes when reacting with objects. These fumes pose a similar threat as direct chemical damage to the head. Any damage taken via chemicals to the head can cause blindness, respiratory distress, and even suffocation.
