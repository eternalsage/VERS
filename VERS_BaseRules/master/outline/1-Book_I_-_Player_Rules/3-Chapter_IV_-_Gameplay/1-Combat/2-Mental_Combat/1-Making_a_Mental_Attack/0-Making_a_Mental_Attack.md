There are three primary ways to initiate mental combat. The first, and most typical, is the Deception skill. Often used in conjunction with other actions, a character can use Deception to make surprise attacks (which can also deal physical and social damage), misdirect a target’s focus (such as a sleight of hand “magic trick”), or to simply make the target believe something is happening that isn’t. Anytime a deception like this is intended to confuse and not to entertain, it is considered a mental attack and the character rolls Deception against the target’s Discipline to determine if it were successful.

The second method of making a mental attack involves abilities. Certain abilities can affect a person’s Focus, and as such count as mental attacks. Again, as a rule of thumb, if the ability is intended to confuse or deceive then is affects Focus.

The final method of making a mental attack involves tactics and strategy, such as an ambush, a surprise attack in the middle of the night, or a particularly witty remark during a social encounter. It can only happen once (you can’t surprise someone twice with the same action, after all), but it can definitely put the opposing group on their heels, disorganized and disheartened. This type of attack uses various skills, such as Tactics, Leadership, or Influence, but the rule of thumb is that any action that can confuse, startle, or distract deals Focus damage.

Mental attacks use Discipline for defense.
