Once the attack is ruled a success and the NDV is determined, the only thing remaining is to apply the appropriate condition. Mental attacks give Focus conditions, which are, in order of least to greatest: Distracted, Flustered, Disoriented, and Distraught.

- **Distracted:** The distracted condition applies if the NDV is between 0 and 2. This is the equivalent of a small diversion of attention, the "hey what's that?" or something similar. A character can have up to 3 of these before they start being upgraded.

- **Flustered:** The flustered condition applies when the NDV is between 3-5. This is the shock of a sudden betrayal, that "et tu Brute?" moment where the character is uncertain of their action for just a split second. A character can have 2 of these before they begin upgrading to the next level. Characters take a -1 penalty to all skills per condition at this level.

- **Disoriented:** The disoriented condition applies when the NDV is between 6 & 8. This is the equivalent of seeing your best friend severely injured, or a character watching in mute horror as the enemy overruns your position. The classic "deer in headlights" level of disbelief. In addition, due to the trauma, any use of skills takes an additional -2 penalty. A character can only have one condition at this level.

- **Distraught:** This condition applies when the NDV is greater than 9. A character whose Focus is so afflicted is essentially disabled, being too confused to function, overwhelmed by the awesome events transpiring around them. A character with the disarrayed condition can still make actions, although they must make a Discipline roll and are restricted to a single simple action per Turn. Their movement speed is also halved. Failure on the Discipline roll means the character falls unconscious. Any action taken while disarrayed upgrades the highest Morale condition by one level as the despair of their situation rises.
