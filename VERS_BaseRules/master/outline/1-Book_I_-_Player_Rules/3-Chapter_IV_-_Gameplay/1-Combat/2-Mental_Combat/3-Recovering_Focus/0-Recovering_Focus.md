Characters recover focus by a combination of discipline and time. Once per day, after a long rest (usually sleep) the character can take a Recovery Action. They make a Resolve roll with a penalty based on the highest severity Focus condition. Success allows them to remove the highest level condition, as well as an addition condition per 3 degrees of success. A successful Meditation roll grants a bonus to the recovery equal to half the degrees of success.

Additionally, a character can take a Quick Recovery after combat to recover Focus. This takes 10 minutes and allows a character to wipe away all Distraction level conditions. A Quick Recovery can also be taken in combat by taking a Complex Action and making a Discipline Roll with a -4 penalty. Focus conditions that come from environmental effects (chaotic noises, flashing lights, etc) can only be recovered once the character is removed from those situations. 

Recoveries and Quick Recoveries apply to all damage types, although they are each rolled individually.
