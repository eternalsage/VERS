As mentioned several times thus far, VERS has more than just physical combat. One of those other forms is mental combat. This typically takes the form of subterfuge, misinformation, misdirection, and other attempts to confuse or deceive. Sometimes these mental attacks are tied into physical or social attacks, such as cunning ambushes or putting a person on the spot with an insightful remark on an embarrassing subject. In these cases both the mental and physical or social attacks are rolled separately (they have different defenses, bonuses, etc) and then applied separately. The attacker may chose the order.
