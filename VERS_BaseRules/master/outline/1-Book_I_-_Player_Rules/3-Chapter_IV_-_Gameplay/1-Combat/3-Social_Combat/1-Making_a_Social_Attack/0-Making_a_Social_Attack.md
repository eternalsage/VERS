There are three ways to make a social attack. The first and most obvious are with skills: Intimidation, Influence, and Animal Handling. Intimidation allows a character to manipulate a target’s fear. Often this is used to get information or to change someone’s mind with threats of violence or other negativity. Influence is a more subtle method, sewing negative thoughts such as fear, doubt, or even inciting anger, jealousy or pride (in the right circumstances). In addition Influence can also be used to heal Morale damage by inspiring positivity as well. Finally, Animal Handling can also be used to make social attacks against animals. The same guidelines apply to it as do the Influence skill. These skills all rely on communication to work, whether it is verbal or body language.

The second manner of making social attacks are abilities and advantages, such as an undead monstrosity projecting an aura of hopelessness or a magic spell of crippling embarrassment. Like Focus targeting abilities, if the ability has the desired effect of weakening will, spreading fear, or otherwise manipulating emotions, it is probably a social attack. This is any unwanted emotional state, and a love potion would damage Morale just as surely as the fierce wail of a banshee.

The final way to make a social attack is roleplaying. For instance, in a sports game an injury to the star quarterback would damage the Morale of the whole team, even though none of them were targeted directly by a social attack. The GM is final arbiter of these circumstantial social attacks and aides, and many times they go hand in hand with mental attacks like ambushes and betrayals.

Social attacks use Discipline for defense.
