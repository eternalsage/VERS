Once the attack is ruled a success and the NDV is determined, the only thing remaining is to apply the appropriate condition. Social attacks give Morale conditions, which are, in order of least to greatest: Unnerved, Shaken, Disheartened, and Demoralized.

- **Unnerved:** The unnerved condition applies if the NDV is between 0 and 2. This is the equivalent of feeling slightly nervous or agitated, such as when hearing a noise at midnight when you are supposed to be home alone or getting called on in class while daydreaming. That feeling of butterflies in your stomach. A character can have up to 3 of these before they start being upgraded.

- **Shaken:** The shaken condition applies when the NDV is between 3-5. This is the shock of a something serious, like getting a glimpse of something waiting in the shadows, your crush blabbing your secrets to the school bully and his friends. The feeling of your heart skipping a beat. A character can have 2 of these before they begin upgrading to the next level. Characters take a -1 penalty to all skills per condition at this level.

- **Disheartened:** The disheartened condition applies when the NDV is between 6 & 8. This is the equivalent of being surrounded and outnumbered by enemies, or your best friend telling you that he was only using you to get help with his homework. Horror but not yet despair. A character can only have one condition at this level before upgrading. In addition, due to the trauma, any use of skills takes an additional -2 penalty.

- **Demoralized:** This condition applies when the NDV is greater than 9. A character whose Morale is so afflicted is essentially disabled, being to terrified or otherwise overcome to function, overwhelmed by the awesome events transpiring around them. A character with the demoralized condition can still make actions, although they must make a Discipline roll and are restricted to a single simple action per Turn. Their movement speed is also halved. Failure on the Discipline roll means the character falls unconscious. Any action taken while disarrayed upgrades the highest Focus condition by one level as their mind succumbs to the confusion of their situation.
