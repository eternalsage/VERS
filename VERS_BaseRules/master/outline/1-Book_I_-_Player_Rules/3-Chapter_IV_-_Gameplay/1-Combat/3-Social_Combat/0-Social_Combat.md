Not only is conflict a situation of swords and overt violence or even grand strategy and planning. Sometimes words are combat, both threats and witty barbs, which threaten a person’s emotional well being opposed to their physical or mental well being. This emotional well being is is tracked by Morale and can be just as deadly as a wound from a blade, eroding a character’s will to continue fighting and clouding their minds with doubt and fear. Sometimes a physical or mental attack also affects Morale, and in these cases both effects are rolled separately and apply damage independently, in the order chosen by the attack.
