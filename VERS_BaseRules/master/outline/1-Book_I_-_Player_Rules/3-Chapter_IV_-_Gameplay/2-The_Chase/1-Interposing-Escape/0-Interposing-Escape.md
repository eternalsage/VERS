The first type of chase is called Interposing, of which the most common use is for the hunter (character trying to stop or catch the other) to cut off the way of escape, such as placing themselves in front of a door. It can resolve in many ways though, such as a sprint to grab an item, trying to brace a door before the hunter gets into the room, or even a tackle to the ground. The equivalent action for the hunted (character trying to get away) is Escaping, which typically involves getting around the hunter, but can also mean they slide under a closing garage door, get across the tracks just before the train comes, or whatever is dramatically appropriate. Either way, Interposing/Escape ends the chase. Either the character is either trapped or gets away (although depending on the circumstances a new chase may begin).

To Interpose, your character must be within a complex move action of the target. This is resolved as an active Athletics + Agility (as opposed to Athletics + Stamina as normal) opposed by the opponentâ€™s Athletics + Agility. Degrees of Success can be used on stunts as the GM sees fit.
