Not all action scenes are fights. In fact, in literature, movies, and TV, the chase is far more common. When the villain produces overwhelming odds, or maybe the guards recognize you based on those wanted notices going around town, either way itâ€™s time to let your feet do the talking. There are three basic stages or types of chase, each with their own mood and drama. Each of them can morph into another as the scene changes and different situations arise within the chase.
