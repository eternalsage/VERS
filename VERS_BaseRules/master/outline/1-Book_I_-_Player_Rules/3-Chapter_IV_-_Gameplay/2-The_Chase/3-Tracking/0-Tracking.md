The final type of chase is Tracking. This is long distance pursuit over hours, days, and even weeks. This is the type of chase that a GM can write an entire Episode around, or even an entire Season. The hunted in this case is well outside of catchable range, and the only method of following is by using Survival to follow physical evidence, like footprints and the like or using Investigation to gather social clues by asking locals, etc.

When tracking a character, the seeker rolls either Survival or Investigation once per day. This roll uses the evaderâ€™s Stealth as the defense, and on a success the seeker keeps on the trail, with degrees of success adding to a tracking tally that works very much like the pursuit tally, with the exception of going to 20 and starting on 10. After getting enough Degrees of Success the seeker catches up to the evader and they transition into pursuit, while 20 Degrees of Failure means the trail goes cold and the evader is well and truly gone.
