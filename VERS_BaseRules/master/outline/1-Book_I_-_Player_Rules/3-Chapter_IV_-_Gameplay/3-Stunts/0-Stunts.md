By itself, combat, even well-narrated and drama-filled combat, can be a little dull. Simply waiting for your turn to roll dice to see what happens becomes little bland. This is an issue that has existed as long as tabletop RPGs have existed, and have driven the majority of innovations in the field. VERS does not claim to be a major innovation, but looks to make what is here fun and engaging without falling into rote repetition.

Stunts are basically little additions that help a player be more descriptive during combat and make the rewards of a good roll less static and more within the control of the player. When a character rolls an attack, they are able to trade their rolled Degrees of Success for these minor effects. Most of the time a character is going to want to use their Degrees of Success on their attack rolls to deal more damage to their enemies (+1 EV per two Degrees of Success), but more strategic options exist, allowing the target to be knocked back, deprived of their defense for a Turn or many other possibilities. In turn, failing the roll allows the target to use these stunts against her in the same manner. These stunts allow the player room to be creative with their attacks without overly penalizing them for poor rolls or gambling away fun in an all or nothing longshot.

The following tables contain the available Stunts, not just for combat, but also miscellaneous roleplay situations. These, of course, are not the only stunts possible. Any time a player wants to do something interesting in combat they should be encouraged. Use these stunts as examples to empower interesting combat and tactical thinking.
