Sleeping is a dangerous endeavor in the wilderness (or a haunted house). One never knows when they may be awakened by wolves, bandits, or perhaps never awaken again. For this reason, most travelers take turns keeping watch so that each can sleep some and all can stay safe. Some characters are in less danger, however, because they have a tendency to sleep lightly.

A character with the Light Sleeper advantage gets to make a Perception roll at a -4 to avoid being ambushed in their sleep. On a success, they are awakened, although they do not necessarily understand the reason for their awakening. The character also has a chance of sleeping poorly through the night, being awoken by non-threatening noises, uncomfortable sleeping arrangements, and nearly anything else. The GM can call for the character to make a Resolve + Stamina roll to determine if the character had a restful sleep. Failure means the character starts with 1 point of Focus and Morale damage. Light Sleeper costs 2 CP.
