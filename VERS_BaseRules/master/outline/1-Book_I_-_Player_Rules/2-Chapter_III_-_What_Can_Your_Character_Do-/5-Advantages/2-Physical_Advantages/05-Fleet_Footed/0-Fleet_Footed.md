Not all characterâ€™s are as slow as they look. Perhaps she trains for speed, or is just a natural athlete. The only thing that matters is that she is faster than average for others of her build and skill. A character with the Fleet Footed advantage gains an additional +3 meters to their base movement speed and an additional +2 to Athletics rolls related to running. Fleet Footed costs 3 CP.
