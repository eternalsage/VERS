A character with the Brawler advantage is skilled with fighting unarmed. Perhaps this is from a long life full of bar-room brawls or the hard childhood of an unfortunately named child, or maybe a life of training under various masters. Whatever the reason, unarmed attacks made by the character can do lethal damage if the character so chooses. Brawler costs 2 CP.
