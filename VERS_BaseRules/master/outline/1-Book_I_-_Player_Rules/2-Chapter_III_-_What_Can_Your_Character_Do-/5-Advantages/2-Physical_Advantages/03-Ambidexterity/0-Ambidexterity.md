Ambidexterity is the ability of being able to use either left or right hand equally well. While this typically has little effect on gameplay, it does enable a character to throw off their opponents with a quick switch of sword hand, possibly qualifying for a Focus attack, or maybe still being able to do things without penalty if injured, etc. Ambidexterity costs 1 CP.
