A character with the Gigantic advantage is huge, standing more than 2 meters tall. This is reflected by the character having a Size of 1 (the average person has a 0). This affects the characterâ€™s starting (and maximum) Strength, movement rate, and reach. The downside is that the character has to duck to fit inside most buildings and normal clothes will not fit them. Gigantic costs 3 CP and must be purchased at character creation.
