With Perfect Body, the character has a constitution particularly suited to dealing with certain common but negative scenarios, such as lack of sleep, consuming questionable food or drink, holding their breath, resisting diseases, resisting toxins (including alcohol), or the fatigue of a hard dayâ€™s labour.  The character must choose one of these things as the subject of their Perfect Body, and they get a +2 bonus to any roll that involves that situation (GM discretion). Perfect Body costs 1 CP, and can be purchased multiple times, once for each type of resistance.
