A character with the Tiny advantage is small, standing less than 1.3 meters in height. This is reflected by the character having a Size of -1 (instead of 0). While this affects the character’s starting (and maximum) Strength, Movement, and Reach, it also makes them harder to spot at a distance (+1 on Stealth rolls), able to get into tight spaces others can’t, and harder to hit when attacking them. Chairs and beds are too tall for her to sit in comfortably, and she has trouble reaching items on top shelves. The character requires special clothing and possibly other accommodations due to her size. Tiny costs 3 CP and must be purchased at character creation.
