Some characters are born with a special place in the world. For whatever reason, fate has decided that great events will pivot on the character’s shoulders. A character with Destiny is meant for something. When taking this advantage, the player should work with the GM to decide what that Destiny should be (in loose terms). Examples include things such as *“Fated to raise a king and to lay a king low,”* *“No man can kill him,”* or *“Born to save a kingdom from a fell beast.”* More vague is better because it gives the GM more room to interpret the Destiny and work it into the overall story. The character is then given 3 Destiny Points, which they can spend to avoid some setback that would prevent them from achieving their Destiny. These points do not regenerate. Once they are spent, they are gone forever. Once that character achieves their Destiny, they either die a heroic death or they are retired as a player character. Destiny costs 10 CP.
