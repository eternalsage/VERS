With Perfect Mind, the character has an innate sense for some commonly occurring but difficult knowledge, such as time, distance, pitch, direction, calculations, or even memory. The character must choose one of these things (or something similar) as the subject of their perfect knowledge, and they get a +2 bonus to any roll that involves that subject (GM discretion). Perfect Mind costs 1 CP, and can be purchased multiple times, once for each type of knowledge.
