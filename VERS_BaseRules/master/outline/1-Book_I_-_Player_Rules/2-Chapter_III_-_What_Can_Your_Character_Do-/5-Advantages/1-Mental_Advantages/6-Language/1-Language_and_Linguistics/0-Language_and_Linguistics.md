Languages are naturally arrayed into language families based on similarities between the languages, both in grammatical structure and the glossary of words. Languages that are close enough to be in the same language family can be partially understood by other speakers of the same family through common words and syntax. This is represented as a Linguistics roll at a -4.

Likewise, multiple families can be grouped together into a larger family (or super-family). This larger group is more tenuously connected than a family, but all the languages in that super-family still come from a common ancestor language, and share enough similarities that with difficulty (an Intuition roll with a -8 penalty) communication can be achieved. Collections of super-families also exist. These macro-families are linguistically important or interesting, but mechanically do nothing.

Sometimes when two languages come into contact for a long time they mix and form a new language, often referred to as a pidgin or a creole. These languages are distinct from both of their parent languages, but can be understood by a speaker of either with effort (an Intuition -2 roll). Each setting should define its language tree, and an example for Earth is included in the appendices.
