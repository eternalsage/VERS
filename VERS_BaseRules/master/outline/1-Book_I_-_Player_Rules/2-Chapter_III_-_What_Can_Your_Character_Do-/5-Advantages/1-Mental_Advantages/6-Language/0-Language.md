The Language advantage gives the character the ability to communicate in different dialects and tongues. Language allows the person to both read and speak the language. Just as real people can know multiple languages, characters can also purchase the Language advantage multiple times, each representing a different language known. A character can know a number of languages equal to twice their Logic.

Every character gets their native language free at character creation, which includes literacy unless the setting would prohibit that, such as a historical or sword and sorcery style settings. Languages that use alternate character sets, such as Russian or Chinese also includes the ability to read and write those characters as well, again unless it is not normal for the setting for some reason. Language costs 1 CP per Language.
