Some characters have a knack for sensing a trap or other danger. Maybe it’s a certain smell in the air, or the sudden quiet where there had just been birds singing, or just a simple feeling that something isn’t right. Whatever it is, a character with Danger Sense gets an automatic Intuition + Insight roll just before a trap or ambush is sprung, regardless of if it is a physical danger like a literal ambush or a social trap, like a trickster trying to get the character to speak ill of the King in his own court. This roll should be made by the GM so as to not tip the players to the dangers if they fail. Danger Sense costs 2 CP.
