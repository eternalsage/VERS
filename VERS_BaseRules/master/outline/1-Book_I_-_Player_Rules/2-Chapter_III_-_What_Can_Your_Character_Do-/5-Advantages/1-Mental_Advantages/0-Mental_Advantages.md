These advantages focus on the power of the mind and the edge that a keen intellect and cunning insight offers a character. These types of advantages are great for those characters who derive their powers from mental acumen, like engineers, doctors, and scientists, although they are also good fit for any character who takes a more cerebral approach to their problems.
