A character with the Encyclopedic Knowledge advantage has the remarkable ability to remember large amounts of information. Rarely is this information as well ordered and thoroughly memorized as an expert in the field would have, but it is enough to remember the answer to the obscure riddle or that in the Cthulhu mythos being buried face down means they were a witch. The character acts as if they have 2 ranks in any Expertise skill. If a character already has ranks in a Expertise skill, this gives them a +2 bonus. Encyclopedic Knowledge costs 10 CP.
