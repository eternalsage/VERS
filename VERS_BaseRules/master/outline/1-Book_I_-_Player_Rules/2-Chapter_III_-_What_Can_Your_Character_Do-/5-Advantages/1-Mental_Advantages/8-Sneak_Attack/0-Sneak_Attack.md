Surprise attacks, like ambushes and feints have the added bonus of not just hurting an opponent but confusing and demoralizing them as well. A character with the Sneak Attack advantage who successfully manages to attack an unaware target or succeed on a Deception (or similar) roll to feint gets half of the physical damage they do to both Focus and Morale. Sneak Attack costs 10 CP.
