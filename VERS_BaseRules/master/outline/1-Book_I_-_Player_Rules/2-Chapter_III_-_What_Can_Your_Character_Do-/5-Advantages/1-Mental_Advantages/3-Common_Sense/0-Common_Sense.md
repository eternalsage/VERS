Common Sense is the innate ability to judge whether a course of action is foolish or not, and a character with this advantage has been graced with this talent. Perhaps it’s inborn, or perhaps it’s hard-won after a lifetime of mistakes, but either way, a character with Common Sense can, once per episode, ask the GM whether they are heading in the wrong direction, or about to start a series of events that might have unforeseen consequences. The GM may only answer with a single word response. Common Sense is 2 CP.
