Some people have a knack for command. People just automatically comply with their orders, even those who might not normally, such as rebellious recruits or even townspeople not involved in the military. Aura of Command is that certain something, and grants the character a +2 bonus on Leadership rolls as well as any other social interactions that the GM approves. Aura of Command costs 4 CP.
