The Membership advantage gives a character entrance to an exclusive group, usually one with some prestige or other power or authority. Each organization offers its members certain benefits (see below) as well as a +2 bonus on any Social rolls involving those with a favorable opinion of the group. This bonus may become a penalty in some situations, such as when dealing with a group that hates or distrusts them. In order to belong to an organization the character must seek out a current member and formally apply to join. The entire process is a role-playing concern, but may include performing tasks, rituals or tests. Membership costs 3 CP.
