Something about a character with the Attractive advantage is exceptionally interesting to those attracted to those of the character’s gender. Maybe it’s his voice, his hair, or his physique, but whatever it is, the character gets a +2 to Influence rolls with potentially interested NPCs. Being attractive has its drawbacks, however, and those who see you remember you, whether they were interested or not. The Attractive advantage costs 1 CP.
