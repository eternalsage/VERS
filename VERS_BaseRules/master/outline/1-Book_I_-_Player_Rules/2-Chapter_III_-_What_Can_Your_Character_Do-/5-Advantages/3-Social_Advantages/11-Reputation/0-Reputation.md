The Reputation trait gives the character the ability to impress others with her stature, giving bonuses to social interactions with others. If the GM rules that an NPC is likely to know of the character's Reputation, then all Social rolls against them gain a bonus equal to the trait's rating. Not all people are awed by Reputation, however, and some people are hostile toward it, giving penalties instead. Reputation costs 1 CP per rank.
