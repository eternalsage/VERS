Contact gives the character the ability to gain information and favors from a single specific source. This information is not always accurate, nor does the favor always need to turn out to the player’s benefit. The bad tip and the unintentional set up are classic plot devices for a reason. However, Contacts should help far more often than hurt the character, otherwise there is no purpose. Contacts take many forms, but things like the King’s bard, the bartender, the war buddy who still works as security, or just the secretary whose life you saved are all classics.

When calling in a favor, ranks in Contact determine how deep the ally’s reach goes, granting a number of automatically successful non-combat rolls equal to their rank. Only rolls directly related to the favor can benefit from these automatic successes. For example, an automatic success on a stealth roll because the ally bribed (or ordered) the guard to look the other way, a Security roll because he supplied a wax copy of the key, or a Pilot Vehicle roll because he sabotaged the pursuing vehicle. Each automatic success used temporarily reduces the ranks of Contact for a month of game time while the informant mitigates the effects of their help. At the end of the episode, the character who called in favors must make a 12/- roll with a penalty equal to the number of favors called in. Failure means the Contact is permanently unable to help the character further, either because they lose their positions or maybe even get killed. A Contact may even become the center of the next mission, as the troop races to save their friend from a certain doom.

When requesting information from an informant, the player can get a bonus equal to the ranks in Contact to a single roll involving that information. Unlike requesting favors this does not negatively impact the informant.

A character can have Contact multiple times, each representing a different node in the character’s web of influence. Relationship NPCs can also be Contacts, but they do not have to be the same characters. Relationships are more roleplay aides and would be people that the character knows well and trusts, while Contacts are more like acquaintances that the character doesn't necessarily need to hang out or keep occupied. Contact costs 3 CP per rank.
