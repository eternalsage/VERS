Companion gives the character an allied NPC who is her loyal ally and friend. Examples include the stalwart bodyguard, the enterprising squire, and the faithful pet. Companions may help with combat, or they may fulfill other duties the primary character cannot, such as repairing and building gear or doing research.

Regardless of their role in the troopâ€™s dynamic, they are still NPCs and thus under the control of the GM. Also, it is important that while they are loyal, they are not suicidal, and will refuse tasks that may involve their injury or death just as a player might, nor will they act as a butler or housemaid to the character (unless actually built as servants, like a noble or rich merchant might have).

For more information about building Companions, see the Antagonists chapter in the GM section. Companion costs 5 CP per rank. Companion ranks operate exactly as ranks of the Clone Ability.
