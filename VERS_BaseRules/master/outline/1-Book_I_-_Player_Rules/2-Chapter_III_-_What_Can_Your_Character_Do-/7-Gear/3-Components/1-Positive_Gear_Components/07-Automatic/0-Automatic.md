This component allows the weapon to hit more than once per attack. The attack strikes the target one additional time per 2 degrees of success the attacker rolls on their attack roll. For each additional hit, reduce the EV by 2. If the weapon is using the Limited Uses negative component then the user must declare up front how many uses they expend before firing, which acts as the upper limit for the number of extra hits possible. This component costs 3 CP.
