This component doubles the item’s maximum range when thrown. This does not change the penalties associated with ranged distance. It also does not necessarily affect the shape of the object, being a generic system, but most items that get this component will be obviously designed to be thrown to the character’s that encounter it. This component costs 1 CP per rank.
