This component Limits the number of uses before it no longer functions, such as running out of ammo, battery charge, fuel, or any other reason. The player must define how the Uses are recovered, such as loading another magazine, charging the battery, or refilling the fuel tank. The starting number of uses is 50, and each additional rank cuts this number in half.  This component reduces the cost by 1 CP per rank.
