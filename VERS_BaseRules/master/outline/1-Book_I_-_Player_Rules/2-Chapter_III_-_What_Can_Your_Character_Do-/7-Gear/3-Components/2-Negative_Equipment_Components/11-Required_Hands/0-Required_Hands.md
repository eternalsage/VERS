This component means the item requires more than one hand to properly use. There are two levels to this requirement, “2 handed” and “1.5 hands.” A 2 handed item requires both hands and cannot even be used without both, such as a bow and arrow. An item that is considered 1.5 handed or “hand-and-a-half” is best used with two hands, but can be wielded one-handed with considerable effort, increasing the minimum Strength required for its use by 1. This component reduces the cost by 2 CP if it requires both hands, or only 1 CP if 1.5 handed.
