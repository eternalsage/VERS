title:          Long Reload
ID:             528

compile:        2


This component makes the item take an extra long time to reload, requiring a whole turn before being usable again. It should be noted that this presupposes the item already has the Limited Uses component, otherwise it does not make sense. This component reduces the cost by 2 CP.
