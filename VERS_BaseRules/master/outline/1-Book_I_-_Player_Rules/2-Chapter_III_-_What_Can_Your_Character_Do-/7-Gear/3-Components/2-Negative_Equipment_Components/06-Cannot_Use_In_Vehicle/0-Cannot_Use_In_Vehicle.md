This component makes the item unable to be used within a vehicle. This may be due to size, bulk, power requirements, or nearly any other reason imaginable, however the overall effect is that this is impossible. This would also apply to weapons that cannot be used on horseback and the like. This component reduces the cost by 2 CP.
