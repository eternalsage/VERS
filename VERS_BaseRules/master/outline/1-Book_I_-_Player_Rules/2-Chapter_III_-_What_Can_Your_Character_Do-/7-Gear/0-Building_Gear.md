Gear is one of the pillars of non-superhero games, and while everything that gear can do is possible with the existing Ability rules, the following optional system makes creating gear streamlined and simple at the cost of certain fringe case scenarios.

Like abilities, gear is a collection of qualities that describe what the item is and does. Each piece of gear has a Description, which is similar to the concept of an ability or character, as well as a Composition, which is similar to the Manifestations and Properties of an ability. Finally, each item has Components, similar to ability Effects.  Note that weapons need a functional range (grappling, close, or ranged), decided at creation.
