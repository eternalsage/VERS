The description of an piece of gear is essential to its proper use in the game. For instance, both a bearded hand-axe and an arming sword would largely be built the same, however they actually work very differently in real life. The description for an arming sword would be something like:

> "A one-handed long sword, roughly a meter in length, and often used in unison with a shield. It is usually associated with knights, but swords that are similar in design to this stretch all the way back to Viking times. Made of a high-carbon steel with a well developed cruciform hilt, these weapons are capable of use in defense as well attack. Double edged with a rather severe point, these weapons excel at both thrusting, stabbing attacks and slashing, cutting attacks."

Compare this to the description of the bearded hand-axe:

> "A one-handed axe designed for war, the handle is roughly 0.75 meters in length and made of a hard wood. The head of the axe is made of a fairly low carbon steel or even base iron, however the edge is a thin wedge of high carbon steel. This gives the edge both hardness and flexibility while remaining very inexpensive to produce. Not a very defensive weapon as the head is largely softer metal and also very narrow, the axe is exceptionally well suited for disrupting and destroying protections. Its mass easily breaks through lighter armors and its long "beard" or extended cutting edge is great for hooking shields and pulling them away"

So even though each weapon would be built as 3 Damage, -2 Size, +2 Mass, however the Description fills in the non-numeric details about what it looks like, how its made, and even how it is used. These details could be relayed through some type of system of costs and discounts, like the Components, but for the most part this is both unwieldy and unnecessary. So long as the bits that relate to the underlying rules are taken into account.
