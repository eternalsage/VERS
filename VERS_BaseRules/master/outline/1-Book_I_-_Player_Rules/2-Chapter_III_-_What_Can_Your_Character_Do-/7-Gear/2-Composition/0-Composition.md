Composition is a short statement of the materials used to build the item, mostly in case the Hardness needs to be determined because the item is being damaged. This does not have to be an overly complex statement, and in many ways single words are often best.

Using the examples above, the arming sword would have the following Composition: Steel, Leather.

Similarly, the example bearded axe above would have the following composition: Wood, Iron, Steel, Leather.

Not only does this allow the quick determination of the item's Hardness, but it also lays out important aspects, like both are conductors of heat and electricity and may rust. It also means that the wood and leather would help prevent the worst of these effects if ever faced with them. Note that each material should be listed in the order of greatest amount used to least.
