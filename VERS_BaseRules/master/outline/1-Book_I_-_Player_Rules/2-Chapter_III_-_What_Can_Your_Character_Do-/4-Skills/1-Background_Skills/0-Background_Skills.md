Certain character concepts may lend themselves to skills that will otherwise be of very limited usefulness, such as Profession (Weaver) for a young squire whose family were poor weavers before he got chosen to learn the way of chivalry. Since knights rarely need a weaving skill it does not make sense to pay for that with character points. If a skill is not going to come up during the course of the game (or only very rarely) then it is a background skill.

A character gets a number of free skill ranks at character creation equal to twice the sum of their Logic and Intuition for these background skills. Whether a skill is or isnâ€™t considered a background skill is up to the GM, but the general rule of thumb is that if the skill is not going to be useful for advancing the plot on a regular basis and is being purchased mostly for roleplay purposes, then it should be considered background.
