Some skills work hand in hand with others. This is called synergy, and it is a one way path from Expertise (typically, although it could be another skill at the GM’s discretion) to other skills like Hacking. After all, having a background in the theories behind a job can greatly improve a character’s chances of understanding a problem and making the best solution. Synergy works by granting a +1 bonus on the rolled skill for every 2 ranks of Expertise. A single skill can get a bonus from multiple synergies and these are cumulative. These synergies are ultimately up to the GM, but most will be self evident.
