If attributes are the character’s inborn talents, then skills are the development and specialization of those talents. Each skill is based on an attribute, although these are not set in stone. While Deception is normally based on Charisma, the GM may decide that in a particular interaction Intuition may be better, such as a phony psychic trying to pass off clever observations as legitimate messages from a dead relative.

Skill ranks range from 0-5 like attributes. However, unlike attributes, a character cannot have a negative rank in a skill. You either know it or you don’t. A 0 ranked skill is unknown to the character, although the character may attempt the skill untrained (just using the attribute) at a -2 penalty. A single rank is equivalent to a student or hobbyist understanding, while ranks 2 to 3 represent the professional range where a character could make a living with that skill. A character with 4 ranks in a skill is considered amazing, and would likely have national or even international fame. A character with a skill ranked 5 would be a legend with fame renowned throughout world and with a legacy that will outlast their own lives.

When advancing the character with character points, the first skill rank costs 1 CP, which rank 2 costs 2 CP, etc. This progressive increase in costs is often referred to as “1 x new rank” or one times new rank. Again, this cost doubles at the natural maximum and above.

When looking through these skills keep in mind that VERS is a universal game. As such, certain settings may add skills or change how they work. In the interest of making the base game as generic as possible, skills suitable for modern, fantasy, and sci-fi settings are detailed in this chapter, along with details for how they may fit into your story or setting.
