Ranged Combat measures a characterâ€™s skill with striking an enemy from a distance, either with weaponry or thrown objects. Ranged Combat combines hand-eye coordination with an intuitive understanding of the movements of the target. Ranged Combat does not affect any attacks made with non-projectile weapons such as swords or spears, unless the character throws them.

In some settings it may be necessary to split this further into thrown, archery, and firearms. In turn, a sci-fi or modern game may require firearms to be further broken down into pistols, shotguns, automatics, and long arms, or something similar.

Ranged Attack is an active skill based on Agility and opposed by either Dodge or Parry.
