Security measures a characterâ€™s skill with breaking or disarming mechanical devices that protect the access to restricted locations or items, most often locks, but may include mechanical traps or the like. Dealing with a security device requires special tools (lockpicks, and shims, for example), which levies a -1 penalty for each tool not present. It also requires time (usually a couple of minutes). If the player wished to hurry the process, they could take a -5 penalty, which would allow them to make the roll as a complex action.

Security is a passive skill that is a non-combat action based on Logic.
