Investigation measures a character’s skill with searching for information, whether that information is from a book (or a library of books), a collection of tapestries, or even the scene of a crime.

To investigate a subject, the Player must first think of a question they would like to answer or a bit of data they would like to learn or know (“What is the creature’s link to this place?”, “Who might cast such a spell and why?”, “Why would a man kill his own brother?”, etc). Then, the GM must decide whether the resource in question contains the information sought at all. If it does, then the character makes a passive roll, with the DR determined by how common the information is to find (more common gives bonuses, more obscure gives penalties), how organized the material is (the local lord’s scriptorium gives bonuses, while the piles of books stacked haphazardly around the victim’s home give a penalty), and how long the character is willing to look (less than a few hours should levy penalties, while long periods like days or even weeks should get bonuses). Success indicates that the character locates the requested information, while the degrees of success may give additional information or further clues.

Investigation is a passive skill that is a non-combat action based on Logic.
