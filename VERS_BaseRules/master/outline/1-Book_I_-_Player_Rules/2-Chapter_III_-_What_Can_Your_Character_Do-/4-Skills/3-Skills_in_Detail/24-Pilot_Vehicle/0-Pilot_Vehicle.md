Pilot Vehicle measures a characterâ€™s skill with maneuvering a vehicle regardless of the size. Note that the Pilot Vehicle skill is not required for normal use of a vehicle, but is instead used when piloting under duress, such as during a storm, in a chase, or while fighting. Pilot Vehicle is like Art and Performance in that it is really a group of related sub-skills. When taking Pilot Vehicle the character must determine what type of Vehicle it applies to. Examples would be groundcraft, watercraft, aircraft, and spacecraft. Not every vehicle will be available in every setting, and some settings may require breaking these examples down even more, such as groundcraft becoming motorcycles, cars, commercial and industrial.

Pilot Vehicle is an active or passive skill that is a simple action based on Agility and opposed by Pilot Vehicle.
