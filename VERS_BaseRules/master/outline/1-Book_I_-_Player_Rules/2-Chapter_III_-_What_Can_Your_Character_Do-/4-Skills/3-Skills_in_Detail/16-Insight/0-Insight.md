Insight measures a characterâ€™s skill with deriving understanding, making connections, and seeking relations between seemingly unrelated events, things, or ideas. This can be either an intuitive leap or gut feeling based on pattern recognition and instinct, or it could be a well structured logic based on deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning. This must be determined at the creation of the character and cannot be changed after the fact. Either way, characters use Insight to put scraps of information together to solve a puzzle, unravel a mystery, or gain some idea of what a person or thing might do next. When Insight fails the results are often wrong conclusions, and GMs that like to keep players in the dark about this type of failed roll should make Insight rolls themselves, thus keeping the players from knowing if the new information they gain is valid or not.

Insight is a passive skill that is a simple action based on either Intuition or Logic.
