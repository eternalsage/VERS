Hacking measures a characterâ€™s skill with making technology do things it was not designed to do. Traditionally this refers to both hardware hacking, such as modifying a handheld game console to be a fully functioning miniature computer, as well as software hacking, like removing security protections on a bank database. In the average setting this is done cinematically as a simple action but in sci-fi settings it may be necessary to play this out as a form of conflict. For information about this please see Book II: Gamesmaster Rules.

Hacking can be an active, passive, or reactive skill that is either a reaction or a simple action and is based on Intuition.
