Leadership measures a characterâ€™s ability to take control of a situation, delegate tasks, and hold subordinates accountable. It could be a charismatic farmer who rallies his village to defense from brigands and raiders, or business executive making tough choices to get through a PR nightmare in addition to the classic military. It is the ability to use authority to achieve a goal while maintaining respect and not diluting authority through dissension, disrespect, or subordination.

Leadership only applies to NPCs and never to Player Characters. All social interactions between players should rely on role-play and decision-making and not random dice rolls. A group of NPCs affected by a successful Leadership roll get a bonus on their rolls for the remainder of the scene equal to half the Degrees of Success.

Leadership is an active skill that is a simple action based on Charisma.
