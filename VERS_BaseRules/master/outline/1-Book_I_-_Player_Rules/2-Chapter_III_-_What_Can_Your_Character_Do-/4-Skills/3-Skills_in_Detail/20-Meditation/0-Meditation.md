Meditation measures a characterâ€™s skill with calming their mind, re-centering their Focus, and driving out distractions. This skill can aid the recovery of Focus conditions, adding +1 for every 2 degrees of success to the next recovery action. In addition, the Meditation skill is the only way to take a recovery action for Focus conditions gained from environmental factors that have not yet been alleviated (short of some abilities or advantages). In this situation, a successful Meditation roll is required to even make the recovery action, and the Meditation roll does not provide any bonus to the recovery, unlike normal. Finally, Meditation allows a character with no Focus conditions to enter the Focused state, gaining a +2 bonus on all rolls for the remainder of the scene.

Meditation is a passive skill that is a non-combat action based on Resolve.
