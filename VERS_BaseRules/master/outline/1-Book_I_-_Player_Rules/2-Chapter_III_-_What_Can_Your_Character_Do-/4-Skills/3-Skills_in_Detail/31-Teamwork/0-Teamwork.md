Teamwork measures a character’s skill with working in tandem with another character. Coordinated effort can wear down even the most powerful foe. This concentrated effort can come in many forms, from the one-two punch, to the classic “hey look over there” while the other gets in position. People who work together regularly for long periods develop an uncanny knack for picking up on the little cues that enable efficient teamwork, while some people actively cultivate those talents with drills and exercises. Regardless, anticipating what your teammates are doing is the key to successful teamwork.

To use Teamwork, all parties must make a Teamwork roll. Each member of the team taking part gets a bonus to their next action equal to the least degrees of success between them. This includes the entire team getting penalties if one member fails their roll as well. A team is only as strong as its weakest member.

Teamwork is a passive skill that is a free action based on Intuition.
