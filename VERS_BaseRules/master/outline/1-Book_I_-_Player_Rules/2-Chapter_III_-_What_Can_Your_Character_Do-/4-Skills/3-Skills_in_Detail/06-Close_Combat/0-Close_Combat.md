Close Combat measures a character’s skill with striking an enemy at close range, either with fists and feet or with weaponry. Close Combat combines natural hand-eye coordination and trained muscle memory and covers everything from the untrained farm boy who fights in desperation up to the Jarl’s champion who has dedicated his life to rigorous training in formal fighting forms. Degrees of success from a Close Combat roll can be used to purchase stunts.

In some settings it may make sense to break Close Combat into a series of smaller skills. For instance, a fantasy game may split Close Combat into Axes, Blades, Blunt, Empty Hand, Martial Arts, and Polearms, while a game based on martial arts movies may break them into fighting styles, like Jujitsu, Karate, Kung Fu, etc. Always check with the GM before

Close Combat is an active skill based on Agility and opposed by either Dodge or Parry. It is typically a simple action, but certain uses are a complex action.
