Parry measures a character’s skill with blocking physical attacks such as punches, kicks, sword swipes, or even a bow shots. This means the attack is actively prevented from striking the character by placing some other object in the path of the attack. This other object could be a less sensitive part of the body (like forearms or hands), a weapon (like a shield or sword) or any other object that would fall between the attack and the target of the attack such as throwing one’s body in the way of an attack on another.

Unlike relying on a character’s innate Dodge attribute, Parrying an attack requires the character use their second simple action in their turn to actively defend. Parry can be used to defend others, so long as the defended party is within reach of the character.

Parry is a passive skill that is a reaction and based on Agility.
