Linguistics measures a characterâ€™s skill with languages, especially how languages form and the sounds that humans make to create them. Because of their studies, they find it easier to adapt to new languages and, through connections like cognates and loanwords, can quickly grasp the fundamentals of speech in a new language even though they have never previously studied it.

A character can make a Linguistics roll to understand any language, although they take penalties depending on how far away in origin a language is. This distance is described in terms of language families that are discussed in greater detail in the advantages chapter.

Linguistics is a passive skill that is a non-combat action based on Intuition.
