First Aid measures a characterâ€™s skill with basic medical procedures, specifically those simple and quick life saving procedures typical of emergency responders. First Aid is all most characters have between themselves and death when a battle goes against them.

First Aid gives knowledge of setting bones, dressing wounds, using tourniquets, removing diseased appendages, and the rudiments of how the human body works. In historical and fantasy settings correlating to before the Renaissance era this would be referred to as Healing or even Leechcraft and is much less useful and is as likely to hurt a patient as help them. In these settings double all DR. From the Renaissance to the Victorian era First Aid is the sum total of Medicine and is all that a doctor character would need to practice. In the modern era Expertise and Profession skills are needed to do more than just basic treatment.

A successful First Aid roll gives the target a bonus on their next recovery roll equal to half the degrees of success.

First Aid is a passive skill that is a complex action based on Logic.
