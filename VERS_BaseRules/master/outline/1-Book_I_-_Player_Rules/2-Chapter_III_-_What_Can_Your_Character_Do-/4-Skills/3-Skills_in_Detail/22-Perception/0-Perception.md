Perception measures a characterâ€™s skill with sensing details of their surroundings. Perception covers the base senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, while any other senses are abilities or special advantages. A character can use Perception to notice things of interest in the environment or to investigate a scene, however it can also be used reactively as a defensive skill to see through Stealth and Deception.

Perception is a reactive or passive skill that is either a reaction or a free action and based on Intuition.
