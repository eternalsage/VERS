Deception is a measure of a character’s skill with tricking others, such as telling a lie, pretending to be someone else, or passing off an object as something it’s not. This skill not only details the language of the character, but also the little things such as mannerisms and body language that go into a convincing performance. This does not require makeup or costuming, although they may give bonuses. If the character is impersonating an existing person and the target is familiar with that person, the character takes between a -4 to a -6, depending on if the person in question was very different in appearance from the character.

Deception can also be used to run confidence games, pick pockets, or do “magic tricks.” All of these things primarily work off of a character’s ability to distract the watcher while making his move. Similarly, characters can use Deception in combat, feinting or feigning injury to force an enemy to drop their guard or get them to overextend themselves. Treat this roll as a Focus attack in addition to the standard damage.

Deception is an active or reactive skill that is either a free action or reaction based on Charisma and opposed by Perception.
