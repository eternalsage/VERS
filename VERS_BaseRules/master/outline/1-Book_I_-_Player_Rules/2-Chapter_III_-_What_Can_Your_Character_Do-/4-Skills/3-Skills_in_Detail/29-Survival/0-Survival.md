Survival measures a character’s skill living off the land, being self-sufficient, and most importantly finding their way through the wilderness. Survival covers foraging for berries and other food, knowing how to determine direction, knowing how to make shelter, and knowing how to make a fire with minimal supplies.

To use survival to determine a character’s direction and navigate an area is a passive roll, using weather and familiarity with the land as penalties. A successful roll will let the character orient themselves toward their goal, while a failed survival roll leads the character in the wrong direction, although not necessarily a completely wrong direction. For this reason GMs should roll Survival in secret.

Survival can also be used to follow the trail of a creature or person, as well as reading signs in the environment to understand what may have transpired there. This skill is typically used in a wilderness environment, but can also be used in an urban environment if the target leaves a trail that the tracker can perceive and follow. After inspecting an area for a few moments, the tracker can make a Survival roll to get an idea of which direction the quarry went. Treat failure the same as when using Survival to navigate. For every 2 Degrees of Success the tracker learns one additional bit of information (i.e. the quarry is wounded, they are wearing armor, or they have an odd gait).

Survival is a passive skill that is a non-combat action based on Intuition.
