Stealth measures a characterâ€™s skill with not being seen or heard. Stealth is more than just being able to put feet down silently, but also being able to anticipate the movements of guards and other searchers. The more searchers that are looking for the character, the harder it is to stay hidden because it is harder to keep track of all the eyes and ears the character is trying to avoid. For each additional searcher beyond two, the character takes a -1 penalty to his Stealth roll in addition to the penalty for the highest Perception rating in the group.

Using Stealth while moving halves movement speed. A character may attempt to move at full speed while using Stealth with a -4 penalty.

Stealth is an active skill that is a simple action based on Intuition and opposed by Perception.
