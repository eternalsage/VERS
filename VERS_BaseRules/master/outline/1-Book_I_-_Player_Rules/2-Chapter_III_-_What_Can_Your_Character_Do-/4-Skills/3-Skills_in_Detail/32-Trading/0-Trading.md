Trading measures a characterâ€™s skill with haggling as well as understanding the typical values of goods. This skill does not only deal with monetary exchange but also service based economies (trading favors for goods or other favors) as well as bartering (trading goods for other goods).

Using Trading to haggle better prices (or better favors or goods, depending) is an active roll. For each degree of success the character gains a +1 on their Resource roll, for each degree of failure  the character takes a penalty.

Other uses for Trading, such as appraising an items worth, determining the best market for an item (maybe the next town over has had a bad harvest and will pay more for these barrels of apples), or understanding other facets of supply and demand are all passive rolls. Like with using Survival for navigation, failures give false information, and thus GMs should handle these rolls in secret.

Trading is an active skill that is a non-combat action, based on Intuition and opposed by Trading.
