The following examples are suitable for any setting, although there may be additional examples that fit your setting, check with your GM.

- **Acting:** The skill of performing a role, either with a pre-written script or screenplay or as an improvisation. This can be either on stage, in front of a camera, or basically anywhere. This is not writing plays, that would be Art (Prose).

- **Dancing:** The skill of rhythmically moving the body, usually but not always, with musical accompaniment. This can be graceful ballet or break dancing or anywhere in between, although in games or settings it would be necessary to break this down further. This is not choreography, that would be Profession (Choreographer).

- **Instruments:** The skill of playing a musical instrument. Most settings would require this to be at least broken down into stringed, woodwind, percussion, etc, but some may require specific instruments like guitar, sax, or drums. This is not writing music, that would be Art (Composition).

- **Oratory:** The skill of speaking in public, either to convey information or simply to entertain. This could be a presidential speech, a comedy routine, or even a poetry reading.  This is not writing the words to be spoken, that would be Art (Prose) or Art (Verse).

- **Singing:** The skill of making music with oneâ€™s voice. By default this includes everything from lullabies to opera, however certain settings or games would require breaking this down further. This is not writing the lyrics, as that would be Art (Verse).
