Performance measures a characterâ€™s skill with doing a series of carefully constructed actions to convey meaning and emotion to those witnessing the performance. Types of performance would be oratory (giving speeches and telling stories), acting, dancing, singing, or playing a musical instrument. Like the other special skills, a character must choose one type of performance to specialize in when taking the skill.

A skilled character can use performance to inspire or unsettle others. A performer can work in appeals to honor, ancestry, duty, sentiment, idealism, religion, or any other fitting subject matter that will resonate with the audience. If the Performance roll is successful, then the audience may take morale damage, or may get a bonus to morale recovery, depending on the purpose of the performance. This has the ability to put characters into an Inspired state.

Performance is a passive skill that is a non-combat action based on Presence.
