Contortion measures the characterâ€™s skill with bending, stretching, and squeezing their body in ways that most cannot. A typical use for contortion is wiggling out of constraints like ropes, while it can also be used to enter small, tight places such as crevasses, and to escape Grappling. A character pinned or held by another character can substitute a Contortion roll for the standard Grappling roll. A successful escape in this way does not give the character control of the grapple like a successful Grappling roll would, the character simply escapes.

Contortion is a passive skill that is a simple action based on Agility.
