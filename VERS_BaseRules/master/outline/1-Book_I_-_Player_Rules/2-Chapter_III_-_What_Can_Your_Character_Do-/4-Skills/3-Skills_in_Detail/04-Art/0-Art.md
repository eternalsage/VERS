Art measures a characterâ€™s skill with creating physical works that detail the struggles of humanity, the heroism of a great leader, or simply just entertain. A character must choose which subsets (painting, sculpture, etc) they are proficient with, but can take Art multiple times to cover more types.

Creating a work of art takes an amount of time appropriate to the work; no one can write down a saga in an afternoon, for instance, but it is perfectly possible to carve runes in a sword in that time. The artist makes an Art roll with any modifiers for equipment (or lack thereof) and the roll result is the quality of the piece, an objective measure of its artistic merit. Just like in the real world, a critically beloved artwork may not actually have a high artistic or monetary value but quality should factor into determinations of worth or importance.

Art can also be used to copy or mimic an existing artwork, with Deception providing a synergy. The degrees of success on the roll are used as a penalty against attempts to validate the copy.

Art is a passive skill that is a non-combat action based on Intuition.
