The following are suitable sub-skills for Art. They apply across most settings, although for some settings they may still  not apply. Unless the setting or the characters focus on art there is no need to break these down further.

- **Animation:** The art of making successive images in such a way that when viewed in rapid succession they appear to move. This would include both traditional and digital animation techniques.

- **Composing:** The art of writing or otherwise creating music, but not performing or playing music, which is Performance. In settings where music notation exists this includes the ability to preserve this in a hard format, otherwise it is purely a function of memory.

- **Cuisine:** The art of cooking, including baking, grilling, and all other forms of food preparation. This is more than just knife skills and knowing what temperature to turn the oven to, however, and includes all of the knowledge for creating artistic flavor combinations and plating displays.

- **Drawing:** The art of making purposeful marks, lines, and shapes which have some meaning or the illusion of representing other objects, persons, places, or concepts. This is regardless of media, and could easily involve a stick and sand, charcoal, graphite pencils, ink, or even digital forms, depending on setting availability.

- **Fashion:** Not suitable for pre-modern style settings, this allows the character to design and create clothing. Not just mundane clothing, however, which would be covered by Profession: Tailor or Seamstress; Fashion is about pushing the envelope and embracing the artistic combinations of textures, colors, and cuts to make unique and daring designs.

- **Engraving:** Similar to drawing or sculpting, Engraving is the art of making purposeful cuts or scratches into a surface and removing material in such a way as to make marks, lines, shapes, and patterns. These could be for their own purpose, such as decorative detailing on furniture or other objects, or it could be for use in other creations, like printing plates or molds.

- **Jeweling:** The art of cutting gemstones to maximize their luster and radiance, as well the ability to set these jewels onto rings or into pendants and the like. It also includes the ability to craft precious metals and other forms of jewelry such as semi-precious stones.

- **Painting:** The art of purposely making patterns, lines, and shapes with pigments suspended in some form of liquid. This includes the use of brushes, knives, digital media, and even splashing techniques, and often involves complex strokes and layering techniques to make meaning or represent an object, person, place, or concept.

- **Photography:** The art of capturing the image of a person, place, or thing using a camera in order to evoke emotions, represent ideas, or illustrate concepts. This also includes filming with a video camera, editing, enhancing, or manipulating images (digitally or using darkroom techniques) and even making collages.

- **Prose:** The art of using everyday language to present concepts, tell stories, and store information. This can be fiction, non-fiction, journalism or even theater and screenplays (similar to composing). The most important aspect is that it does not contain meter, rhyme, or any other hallmark of verse.

- **Sculpting:** The art of purposely making shapes and forms from materials, either my working with soft materials and building them up additively or working with hard materials and cutting and chiseling them down subtractively. This includes both pottery and other ceramics as well as digital work.

- **Verse:** The art of using carefully constructed language to convey emotion, meaning, and message, often through extended use of metaphor or simile. The can be poetry or lyrics to be sung, but it does not include the ability to sing, which would be a Performance.
