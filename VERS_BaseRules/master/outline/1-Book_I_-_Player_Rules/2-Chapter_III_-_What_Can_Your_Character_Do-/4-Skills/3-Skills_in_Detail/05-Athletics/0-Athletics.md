Athletics measures a character’s skill with running, jumping, swimming, scaling cliffs, climbing rope, or to doing any other action that requires a degree of manual dexterity, balance, physical strength and stamina. A character’s base Movement is also based on Athletics, equal to 5 + Agility + Size + Athletics.

An Athletics roll is not required to climb a ladder or stairs, although in stressful situations such as being chased or during a fire the GM may decide they pose a significant enough danger. Equipment and environment play a large part in the ease of a climb, and lacking any of the core climbing equipment (climbing axes, shoes, pitons, glove, and rope) will add to the DR. Consider a free hanging rope (not hanging near a wall or other surface) a smooth vertical surface (DR 8) while a knotted free hanging rope (ropes with knots at regular intervals) or thick chain would be a vertical surface (DR 6).

A character can, after after at least a simple action move, jump horizontally  a number of meters equal to Agility + Athletics (half that from a standing start). Similarly, after a simple action move a character can vertically jump ¼ of that amount (again, half for a standing start).

Athletics is an active or passive skill that is a simple action based on Stamina and opposed by Athletics.
