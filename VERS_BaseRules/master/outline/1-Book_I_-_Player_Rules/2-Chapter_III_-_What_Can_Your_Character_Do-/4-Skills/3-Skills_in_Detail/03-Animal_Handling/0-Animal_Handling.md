Animal Handling measures a character’s skill with animals, teaching tricks, calming, and even riding them. Working with animals is a tricky thing, and working in the right environment (one without distractions where the animal feels safe) and with the proper equipment (treats and toys) is imperative. Lacking these necessities imposes anywhere from a -1 to a -3 penalty, depending on the situation. In addition, Animal Handling can be used to make social attacks on animals, or to aide in their recovery.

A typical use of Animal Handling is teaching animals new tricks or behaviors. Tricks are limited commands that cover a very narrow scope of situations, while behaviors are a grouping of related tricks into a cohesive package allowing an animal to do a job or fulfill a role. To teach an animal either a trick or a behavior the character makes his Animal Handling roll, with any Degrees of Success reducing the amount of time required to teach the animal. An animal can learn a number of behaviors equal to twice its trainer’s Logic or three times the trainer's Logic in separate tricks.

Animal Handling is an active skill that is a simple action based on Presence and opposed by Discipline.
