- **Alert:** This trick allows the animal to alert its master when a given circumstance happens (typically when an unknown person or creature approaches). This trigger circumstance is part of the training, and must be set at the time of the training, and cannot be changed thereafter, although the trick can be trained multiple times.

- **Attack:** This trick allows the animal to attack a target designated by its master. It will continue attacking the target until it is killed, the animal becomes Impaired or worse, or it is called off with another trick, such as heel or down.

- **Defend:** The trick allows the animal to protect a target, which it will do with its life. If threatened (or it witnesses an action it deems as threatening) the animal will attack the threat head on. This does not require the Attack trick.

- **Down:** This trick allows an animal to break off from an Attack or Defend action. Unlike Heel, Down does not require a Discipline roll to comply, as Down acts on the inherent dominance in the master/pet relationship.

- **Hardened:** This trick allows an animal to endure the chaos of battle, including the sounds of shouting, the smell of blood, and the swift movement of people. An animal without this trick will not willingly enter mass combat, and may bolt from fright if they are made to.

- **Heel:** This trick allows the animal to drop any action it is currently engaged in and return to its master’s side. Predator animals engaged in the Attack or Seek actions must make a Discipline roll to comply, as those tricks have a chance to waken their dormant bloodlust.

- **Herd:** This trick allows the animal to keep together a group of other animals, such as a sheepdog and a herd of sheep. Without the Defend or Alert tricks, the animal will simply keep the creatures together, but will not necessarily protect them or alert its master to evil’s presence.

- **Patrol:** This trick allows the animal to protect an area, walking its perimeter and actively seeking intruders. Without Defend or Alert, however, the patrolling animal will not necessarily do anything with any intruders it finds.

- **Play Dead:** This trick allows the animal to entertain by falling over on cue.

- **Retrieve:** This trick allows the animal to bring a targeted object back to its master. The animal must be able to see the object, or to have seen where it fell/went to be able to retrieve it.

- **Roll:** This trick allows the animal to entertain by turning itself over on its back, possibly multiple times, before springing back up.

- **Seek:** This trick allows the animal to find objects or creatures (usually by scent). When coupled with other tricks, the animal could Attack the found target, Retrieve it, Defend it, or Alert its master to the object or creature’s location. Without other tricks, it will simply lead its master to the object or creature’s location.

- **Speak:** This trick allows the animal to entertain by calling on cue. Birds capable of language can say actual words, although they do not actually understand them.

- **Stay:** This trick allows an animal to remain in one place when its natural inclination would be to follow or otherwise move.

- **Summon:** This trick allows the animal to come to its master’s side when called. This is typically its name, but could be any other words or even sounds, like a whistle.

- **Tame:** This trick allows a wild animal to be tamed and willing to work with humans (or even be around them). It does not remove their wild instincts, and a Tamed animal must make a Discipline roll to perform any trick that goes against its nature (Attack for an herbivore, for example).

- **Teamwork:** This trick allows an animal to move in unison with its master, having learned what actions are expected in a given circumstance and to anticipate those actions.

- **Work:** This trick allows an animal to do labor, such as plow a field or pull a cart, which an animal will not willingly do otherwise. This also includes carrying riders or heavy loads.
