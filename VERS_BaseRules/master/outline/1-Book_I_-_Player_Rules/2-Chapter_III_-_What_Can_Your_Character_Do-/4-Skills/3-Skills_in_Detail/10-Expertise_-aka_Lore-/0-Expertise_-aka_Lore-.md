Expertise and its historical and fantasy cousin Lore measures a characterâ€™s skill with knowing or retaining data relating to a specific topic, such as history, mathematics, or clan heraldry. Like Art and Engineering, Expertise is actually a subset of skills, each dealing with a different focus. This means a character could have multiple instances of the skill, each for something different and each with their own ranks and costs.

Expertise is a passive skill that is most often a simple action, typically based on Logic or Intuition.
