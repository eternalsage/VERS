The following are common examples of the Expertise skill. They should apply across most settings, although some settings may need to be more specialized.

- **Culture:** The study of the arts, crafts, and customs of a society. This includes their literature and other forms of expression, both modern and historic. In more modern or even sci-fi settings it may be necessary to narrow this to specific periods or geographic locations, or types of culture, like literature, pop culture, etc.

- **History:** The study of what came before, using both textual information like written accounts and physical clues like buildings, remains, and art works. In more modern or even sci-fi settings it may be necessary to narrow this to specific periods or geographic locations, depending on realism requirements.

- **Law:** The study of the legal system, both in practice and in theory. This knowledge does not make a character a lawyer or judge as both of those are Professions, however it does make each of these professions better at what they do. In more modern or even sci-fi settings it may be necessary to narrow this to specific types of law, such as commercial, defense, etc, depending on realism requirements.

- **Mathematics:** The study of numbers and their relations. This includes the knowledge of the background theories, the practical uses, and the general ability to do the calculations. In more modern or even sci-fi settings it may be necessary to narrow this to specific branches or applications, depending on realism requirements.

- **Philosophy:** The study of logic and its use to try and make sense of the world. This is the background out of which science arises, and many philosophers are after the same goals of understanding our place or purpose in the universe and how we should behave as part of it. In more modern or even sci-fi settings it may be necessary to narrow this to specific branches, periods, geographic, or ideas, depending on realism requirements.

- **Politics:** The study of how governments work, how power can be used to both control a population or to set it free, and more. This does not just include these theoretical underpinnings however, and experts of politics also know where power is concentrated and who welds it.

- **Religion:** The study of faith and its manifestations. This includes both knowledge of beliefs themselves but also how various religions interact with one another and the various interpretations of scriptures and traditions. In more modern or even sci-fi settings it may be necessary to narrow this to specific periods, geographic locations, or traditions depending on realism requirements.

- **Science:** The study of the natural world with a focus on trial and error experimentation and rigorous peer review. This is not just the knowledge of current scientific understanding but also an understanding of the methodology of science and how it can be applied to life in general. In more modern or even sci-fi settings it may be necessary to narrow this to specific field or even subfields depending on realism requirements.
