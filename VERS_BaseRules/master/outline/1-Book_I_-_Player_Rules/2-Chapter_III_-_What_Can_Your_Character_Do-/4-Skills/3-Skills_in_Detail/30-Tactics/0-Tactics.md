Tactics measures a character’s skill with surveying a battlefield or large-scale conflict and making choices concerning the placement and movements of troops and other units in relation to defenses both natural and man-made. A leader of a unit can use Tactics to give his unit bonuses (or offset penalties) based on battle conditions.

Tactics is one of the primary skills used in large-scale battles. Tactics can, however, be used in smaller scenarios. With GM permission, Tactics can be used to lay ambushes or make plans for a small group such as a special forces unit or the like. For every 2 degrees of success in such a scenario grant the character and his group a +1 bonus to either combat or defense rolls (rolling character’s choice) during that scene.

Tactics also determines a character’s success at board games such as chess and checkers, or any other game in which the GM determines strategy is more important than luck or athletic skill. In such uses between player characters the most degrees of success is the winner. If playing against NPCs make an active roll against their Tactics.

Tactics can be either an active or passive skill based on Logic. It can be opposed by either Perception or Tactics.
