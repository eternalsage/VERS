Influence measures a character’s skill with turning a social situation to the character’s advantage, persuading others into a certain actions or beliefs. Similarly, a character could use Influence to calm or soothe a target, giving a bonus on the target's next social recovery roll equal to half of the degrees of success. Finally, this skill can be used to give the target an Inspired condition, where by, if the target has no Morale conditions, they gain a +2 to all their actions until the end of the scene.

Influence is an active skill that is a simple action based on Charisma and opposed by Discipline.
