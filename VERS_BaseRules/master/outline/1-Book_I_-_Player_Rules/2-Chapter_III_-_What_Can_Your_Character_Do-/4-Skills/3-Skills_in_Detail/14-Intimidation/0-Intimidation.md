Intimidation measures a characterâ€™s skill with striking fear into the heart of a target. Intimidation relies on the illusion of power by the user, so possible modifiers could come from whatever actions had immediately preceded the skill roll. Intimidation can also be used on a group, as long as the group can both hear and see the character.

Groups of people have a certain point of no return in which they switch from calm to full scale panic, and for simplicity this is average Discipline present. This means that a random mob in the streets is way more likely to panic and trample each other in fear than a veteran military brigade. Successful Leadership rolls can give a bonus to this, 1 point per 2 Degrees of Success, up to the leader's Discipline, however this requires active response from said leader, which would be a standard action, and the ability of the majority of the group to see and /or hear the leader.

Intimidation is an active skill that is a free action based on Presence and opposed by Discipline.
