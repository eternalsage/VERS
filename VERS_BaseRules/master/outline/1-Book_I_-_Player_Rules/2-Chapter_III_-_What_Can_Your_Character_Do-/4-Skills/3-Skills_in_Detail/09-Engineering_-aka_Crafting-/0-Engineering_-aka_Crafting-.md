Engineering measures a character’s skill with creating or maintaining any item that could be considered technology. Engineering, like Art, is actually a nebulous collection of possible sub-skills united by a common theme. A character does not have ranks of Engineering, but instead has ranks of Engineering (Chemical) or Engineering (Electrical). Engineering varies greatly between settings, with the word “engineering” really only applying since the Industrial Age. Ancient or fantasy settings would instead use the “crafting” variant, which is less science and technology oriented.

Engineering is a passive skill that is a non-combat action based on Logic.
