The following are some examples of Engineering sub-skills applicable to most settings ranging from those roughly analogous to the renaissance to the near future. Unless the game consists of lots of engineering based scenarios or characters, the following list is broken down far enough and there is no need to go deeper (breaking mechanical engineering into military engineering and so forth).

- **Chemical Engineering:** The study of chemical properties and how their manipulation can lead to better living for humans. This would be used to design new chemicals, determines the properties of existing chemicals, or create or manufacture chemicals for use by the character or troop.

- **Civil Engineering:**  The study of building and construction and how to maximize those constructions chances to survive disasters and other problems while still maintaining comfort for humans. Used to plan and construct bases and discover structural weaknesses to exploit.

- **Electrical Engineering:** The study of transistors, diodes, silicon wafers, circuits and more, including how to optimize their performance and minimize their footprint. This does not include programming said devices (apart from the rudimentary programming possible by arranging circuits in certain arrangements). Used to design, create, and repair devices powered by electricity including gadgets for the troop to use.

- **Genetic Engineering:** The study of genetics and their manipulation, either to minimize negative traits or to maximize positive traits. Genetic engineering can even be used to give creatures wholy new traits or traits from other creatures. Used to design and create medicines and other drugs.

- **Mechanical Engineering:**  The study of machines and their applications, from simple devices like pulleys and levers to laser guided missiles and sports cars. Used to design, create, and repair machines, observe and discover weaknesses in machines, and, in conjunction with Electrical and Software Engineering, design and create robots.

- **Software Engineering:** The study of computer programming, building complex applications that function as tools or even weapons. This is not the same as Hacking, which is the specific use of tools often developed with this skill. Used to design, create, and repair digital systems, and diagnose bugs and other weaknesses in software.
