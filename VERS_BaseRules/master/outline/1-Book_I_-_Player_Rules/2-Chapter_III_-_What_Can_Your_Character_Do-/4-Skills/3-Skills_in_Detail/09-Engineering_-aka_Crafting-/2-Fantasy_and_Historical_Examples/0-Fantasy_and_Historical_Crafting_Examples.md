The following are examples of the Crafting version of the skill suitable for games set in ancient times up through the late Middle Ages. Like the above specialties it should not be necessary to break these down any further (such as Blacksmithing into Armorsmithing and Weaponsmithing, for example) unless there are multiple characters who are crafting or the game story focuses on it.

- **Blacksmithing:** The craft of taking raw metal and, through heating and striking, creating useful tools and other objects. This skill allows a character to design, create, and repair metal armor, weapons, and tools as well as appraising the workmanship of these items.

- **Bowyery:** The craft of making bows of all kinds (except compound bows, which are made with Mechanical Engineering). Allows the character to design, create, and repair bows, crossbows, arrows and bolts as well as appraising the workmanship of these items. It may also allow for the creation of ballista and other siege weaponry that rely on stored mechanical energy when combined with Carpentry in appropriate settings.

- **Carpentry:** The craft of taking wood and using it to create objects useful to people. The skill allows a character to design, create, and repair buildings, structures and objects out of wood, including homes, carts, and barrels and crates as well as appraising the workmanship of these things.

- **Enchanting:** *Fantasy Only* The craft of imbuing an otherwise mundane item with magical properties. This skill allows a character to design, create, repair, or otherwise alter magical items, as well as appraising the workmanship of such things.

- **Masonry:** The craft of using stone and mortar to create structures. It allows the design, creation, and repair of buildings, fortifications, and bridges as well as appraising the workmanship of these things.

- **Shipbuilding:** The craft of making seaworthy vessels. This allows the the character to design, create, and repair boats, rafts, ships or any other type of floating vessel as well as appraising the workmanship of these things.
