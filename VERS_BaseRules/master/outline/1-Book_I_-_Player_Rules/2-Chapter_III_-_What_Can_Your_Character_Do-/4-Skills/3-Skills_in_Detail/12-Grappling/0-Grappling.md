Grappling measures a characterâ€™s skill with grappling techniques such as holds, breaks, throws, and any other type of attack used during a grapple. Grappling combines natural strength and flexibility with anatomical knowledge of pressure points and the limits of bodily function to form a devastating and often inescapable barrage of brutal attacks that easily incapacitate foes. Grappling does not include any type of striking with hands or other body parts or any weapons except those that increase leverage to hold, break, or strangle enemies, such as a garrote.

In certain settings, such as martial arts themed games, the Grappling skill may be broken up further into distinct types of grappling, like Clinches, Reversals, Submissions, Takedowns, and Throws.

Grappling is an active skill based on Strength and opposed by Grappling. It is typically a simple action, but certain uses are a complex action.
