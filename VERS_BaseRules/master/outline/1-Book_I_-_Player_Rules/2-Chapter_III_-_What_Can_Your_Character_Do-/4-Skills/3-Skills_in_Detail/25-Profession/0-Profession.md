Profession measures a characterâ€™s skill with performing a set of tasks which fall within the purview of a certain occupation or activity, but which fall outside of the purview of other skills. For instance, Profession (Thief) would not cover Stealth, Security, or Deception, but it would give insight into where to find a fence in need, where to purchase supplies unnoticed, and other tips and tools of the trade. Profession is especially prevalent among NPCs or PCs raised or trained for a specific job, such as military personnel, farmers, and teachers among many others.

Profession is a passive skill that is a non-combat action based on Logic or Intuition.
