Discipline is the attribute that describes a character’s ability to avoid both social and mental attacks as well as act against certain mental and social disadvantages. It may be cultivated through training as a soldier or athlete would, or may simply manifest as a natural talent. A character’s ability to ignore distractions and shrug off disheartening experiences is greatly influenced by both their mental fortitude and their ability to stay calm under pressure. For this reason, Discipline is the sum of Resolve and Composure.

Whenever an character faces a situation that would challenge his Focus or his Morale he rolls his Discipline, either as an active roll (if an enemy is trying to intimidate him) or as a passive roll (trying to study a tome of magic in a noisy tavern). Discipline does not power any skills, it is used by itself and is considered an Reactive Roll.
