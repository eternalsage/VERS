A character’s Movement measures how far they can move in a simple action while in combat. This base Movement takes the form of the most appropriate type for the character in question, such as running for a terrestrial creature, flying for a bird or bat, or swimming for a fish or dolphin, for examples. Exotic types of Movement like teleportation cannot be the base Movement type without GM permission.

If a character changes forms for some reason, and the new form would have a different primary Movement then the character would simply shift his standard base Movement to the new type for the duration of the time in the new form. In other words, instead of becoming a hawk who can sprint 8 meters per simple action and can’t fly at all, the character would instead transfer her run speed of 8 meters per simple action into a fly speed of equal ranks and have their run speed reduced to 0.

Starting Movement is equal a number of meters per simple action equal to 5 + Agility + Size + Athletics. Assuming a human character, climbing, crawling, and swimming all have a rank equal to half of this. Human characters consider flying, teleportation, tunneling, and phasing through matter (to name a few) to be exotic forms of Movement.
