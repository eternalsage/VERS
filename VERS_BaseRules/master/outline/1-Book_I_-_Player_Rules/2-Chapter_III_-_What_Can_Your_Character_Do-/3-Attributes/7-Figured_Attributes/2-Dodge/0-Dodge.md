Dodge is the attribute that describes a character’s ability to avoid physical damage. This may manifest as a small movement like turning at just the right time, or it may involve something much bigger like diving away from a grenade; whatever is appropriate for the game setting and situation at hand. A character’s ability to Dodge is greatly influenced by both her situational awareness and her general dexterity. In essence a character cannot dodge an attack she cannot sense coming, nor can she dodge an attack coming faster than she can move. For this reason, Dodge is the total of a character’s Intuition and Agility.

Whenever a character faces an attack or other physical danger roll her Dodge, either as an active roll (dodging an attack) or as a passive roll (leaping out of the way of a rockslide). Dodge does not power any skills, it is used by itself and is considered an Reactive Roll.
