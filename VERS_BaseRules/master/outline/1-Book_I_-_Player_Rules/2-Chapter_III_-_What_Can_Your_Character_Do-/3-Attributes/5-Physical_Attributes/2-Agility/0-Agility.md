Agility is the attribute that represents a characterâ€™s physical finesse. This is both a measure of how flexible a character is as well as how much control he has over his body. Hand-eye coordination, muscle memory, and both gross and fine motor control are all covered by Agility; if it involves the body in motion it is a function of Agility. Characters with a high Agility are often extremely graceful, seeming to glide across the ground when they walk, or to resemble a cat when poised to strike. They tend towards nimble, quick movements, and great flexibility, with deliberate movements that can seem otherworldly to others.
