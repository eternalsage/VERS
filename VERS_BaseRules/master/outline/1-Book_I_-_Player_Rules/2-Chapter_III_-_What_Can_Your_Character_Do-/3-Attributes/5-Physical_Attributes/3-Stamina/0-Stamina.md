Stamina is the attribute that represents a characterâ€™s physical resistance. It is a measure of how much exertion a character can sustain as well as how much punishment they can endure. It also represents their immune system in games that deal with diseases, such as a hard sci-fi, pulp-era, or historical setting. Characters who excel in Stamina can stay up late with no ill effects, run long distances without tiring, and are almost never sick. In many ways, Stamina is a gauge for the overall healthiness of a character, like a snapshot of their physique in a number. Sometimes characters who are otherwise not very physically fit, like those with low Strength or Agility attributes will still have several ranks in Stamina for this reason.
