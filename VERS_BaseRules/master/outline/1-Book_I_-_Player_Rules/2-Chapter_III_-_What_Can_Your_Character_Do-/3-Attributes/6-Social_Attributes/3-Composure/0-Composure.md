Composure is the attribute that represents a character’s social resistance. It is a character’s ability to ignore taunts and insults, overcome depression, and act even when terrified. It is a collected calm that prevents both rage and panic and allows characters to remain focused in stressful situations. Characters with many ranks in Composure are often calm and in control regardless of the situation, rarely giving in to a sense of panic or dread. This can lead to them being perceived as disconnected from events or disinterested in them, even if that is not the case. Those characters that excel in Composure are often described as “cool under pressure” or “unflappable.”
