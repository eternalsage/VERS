Charisma is the attribute that represents a character’s social finesse. It measures the ability to say or do things that put others at ease (or on edge), subtly manipulating them into seeing things the character’s way or getting them to divulge important information. A character with a high Charisma is often thought of as silver-tongued and can talk his way into (or out of) nearly any situation. Also often popular at parties, a high Charisma character is usually a conversationalist par excellence, carefully balancing well-told stories and anecdotes with attention to others to make them feel at home around them. One adjective to describe them would be charming.
