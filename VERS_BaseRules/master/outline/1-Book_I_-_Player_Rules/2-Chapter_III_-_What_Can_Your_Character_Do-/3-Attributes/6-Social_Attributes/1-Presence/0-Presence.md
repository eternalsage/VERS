Presence is the attribute that represents a character’s social power. It measures that intangible allure that appeals or repulses without a word. It is the quality that makes certain people stand out in a crowd that often stems from some combination of features, confidence, and posture. Characters with a high Presence are often the centers of attention, although they may not always exalt in that attention. Having high ranks in Presence is not equivalent to narcissism, however. Characters often feel as uncomfortable with their recognizability as they feel flattered. Sometimes such characters are as likely to make people feel uneasy as they are to make them feel welcome. The one adjective often used to describe characters with a high Presence is “intense,” and those who know how to harness that power are quite dangerous.
