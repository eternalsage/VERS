Intuition is the attribute that represents a character’s mental finesse. It measures the non-logical parts of intelligence, such as creativity, emotional awareness, and “gut reactions.” Characters with high Intuitions are often more creative, quick-witted, and rarely caught without an answer for the situation at hand. They also tend to be keenly perceptive. Those in knowledge and craft related professions gravitate toward invention and discovery of new ideas, while those of a less artistic or philosophical bent are still drawn to the romantic notions of stories and craftsmanship.
