Logic is the attribute that represents a characterâ€™s raw mental power. It measures the purely mathematical part of intelligence that allows a person to do difficult computations and follow complex directions. Characters who excel in Logic are often quick to deduce obscure facts from small observations. They also typically have no problem learning new concepts and methods or thinking about abstract ideas. Still, unless they also have high ranks in Intuition, they are unlikely to entertain ideas outside of a relatively well-understood world-view, which often makes them poorly suited to discovering new knowledge or ideas.
