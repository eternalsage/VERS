Resolve is the attribute that represents a characterâ€™s mental resistance. It measures the ability to maintain focus even in chaotic environments, resist temptation, and to force the body to action beyond the limits of normal endurance. It is, in essence, single-minded desire toward some specific end. Characters that possess many ranks in Resolve are often hard to persuade or dissuade, stubborn both in virtue and vice and as unlikely to heed the advice of others as they are their insults. A willful character charts their own course, be it one for triumph or disaster. They are also unlikely to need a shoulder to cry on, tending to prefer to keep their problems to themselves.
