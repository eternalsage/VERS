Size approximates how large or small something is. It’s not a precise method of measurement but instead a rough guide for making estimations. While Size ranks primarily measure the volume of an object, for simplicity a GM should estimate based on height of bipedal creatures or the length for quadrupedal creatures.

Size primarily factors into three areas: Movement, Reach, and Strength. A character’s Movement is equal to 5 + Size + Agility + ½ Athletics. A bipedal character’s Reach is equal to their Size, while a quadrupedal character’s Reach is equal to their Size -1. Finally, a character’s starting Strength is equal to their Size and their maximum Strength is equal to their Size + 5. If a character’s size changes for any reason all of these related characteristics also change to match.
