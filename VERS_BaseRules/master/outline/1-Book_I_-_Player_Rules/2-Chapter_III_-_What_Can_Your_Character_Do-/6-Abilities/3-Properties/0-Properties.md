If the manifestation describes what an ability looks like (or sounds like, etc), then a Property describes in broad terms how it interacts with the world around it. It is a shorthand way to describe how abilities should work together as well as interact with the characters and the environment. For instance, the property of “water” or “wet” would logically and naturally dictate that it would extinguish or suppress abilities with the property of “fire”. Properties also give an easy way to define groups of powers that share commonalities that other abilities can use as targets, such as a spell that prevents “evil” creatures from entering an area, anti-”magic” shackles, or a scanner that detects “mutants”.

In their essence, properties are a type of tag that tells everyone at the table what to expect when interacting with them. Fire is hot and makes light, gravity holds you down, and mutant abilities come from birth. These are all things that are true by definition. A GM shouldn’t require a player to purchase another ability to simulate the fact that an ice ability may also inflict frostbite, or a fire ability may catch something on fire. Properties should not define the primary purpose of an ability. If a clever player thinks to use their flaming sword spell as a torch, that is a great example of lateral thinking and should definitely not be penalized.

Finally, an ability can have as many or as few properties as it needs. In other words, if an advanced alien race came to earth and taught a character an alien style of martial arts that gives them super-heroic powers derived from the dream consciousness of their semi-divine ancient ancestors, their abilities could have any or all the following sources: Divine, Psychic, Alien, and Martial Arts.
