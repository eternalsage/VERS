The Afflict ability enables a character to force another character to suffer from a negative status, such as having a disease of loss of one of their senses. Afflict cannot directly kill a character, but some of its uses, like spreading diseases and suffocation can produce death as a side effect. Afflict is a targeted ability resolved by an attack roll.

Once the attack is ruled a success and the NDV is determined, the only thing remaining is to apply the appropriate condition. Afflict gives Status conditions, which are, in order of least to greatest: Simple, Minor, Major, and Extreme. For examples of each, see the chart bellow. In all cases these afflictions only last as long as the primary character sustains the ability. The effect begins as soon as the attack roll is successful and ends as soon as the caster stops focusing on it. If the player adds the Instant aspect, the only way to remove the effect is through conventional (roleplaying) means or the Cure ability.

- **Simple:** The Simple condition applies if the NDV is between 0 and 2. These are small cosmetic changes and those with no mechanical effects.

- **Minor:** The Minor condition applies when the NDV is between 3-5. These are small changes that offer only 1-2 points of benefit or penalty.

- **Major:** The Major condition applies when the NDV is between 6 & 8. Larger changes that offer greater alterations, however the changes or alterations are still within the realm of nature.

- **Extreme:** This condition applies when the NDV is greater than 9. Purely supernatural changes, changes that cannot be undone, or changes that completely change one thing into another.

Afflict costs 3 CP per rank.
