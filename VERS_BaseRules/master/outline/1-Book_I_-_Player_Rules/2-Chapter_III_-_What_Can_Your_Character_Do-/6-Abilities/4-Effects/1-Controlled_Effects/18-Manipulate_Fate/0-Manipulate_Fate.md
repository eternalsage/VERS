The Manipulate Fate ability allows a character to attempt to alter the outcome of a roll, either to help a roll he makes succeed or help a roll an opponent makes fail. Each rank gives a character an additional use of the ability in a session. Each time a character uses this ability, the bonus (or penalty) they give is equal to their total ranks in Manipulate Fate. In other words a character with 4 ranks in Manipulate Fate could use the ability 4 times each session and each time they did would get a +4 bonus or give a -4 penalty.

Manipulate Fate costs 5 CP per rank, and cannot be tied to an attribute.
