The Alternate Form ability allows a character to assume a completely different shape or form, complete with any inherent abilities the other form may have. In all respects the character takes on the physical (and physiological) aspects of this other form, although by default the character retains their mental and social attributes and personality regardless of their current form.

Ranks of Alternate Form form a pool used to define any changes to the character that occur because of the transformation, such as enhanced physical attributes or new abilities. A character cannot gain mental or social attributes or skills via Alternate Form because it is a physical transformation only. The character still thinks and acts the same and still knows the same things. Only their physical form changes.

To use the ability, choose the new form that the character wants to go towards, then spend the ranks in the Alternate Form pool matching the attributes of the new form as closely as possible (for example templates see the appendices). As a +0.5 aspect the character is free to assign their ranks as they wish, no longer being constrained to pre-constructed templates. As a -0.5 aspect the character only has one single form with a predetermined template.

Alternate Form costs 3 CP per rank, and cannot be tied to an attribute.
