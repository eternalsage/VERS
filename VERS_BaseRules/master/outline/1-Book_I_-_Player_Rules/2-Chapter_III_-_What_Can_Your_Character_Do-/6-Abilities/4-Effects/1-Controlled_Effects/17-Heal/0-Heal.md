The Heal ability allows a target to better recover from damage to physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual damage. The target gains a bonus on their next recovery action equal to half the degrees of success on the roll, as well as an immediate recovery action, regardless of whether they would normally get one. The user must decide what type of status their Heal ability targets when creating it, Focus, Injury, or Morale. With GM permission it can even be used to remove Damage conditions on objects. A character can resist being healed if they wish, making the roll active.

Heal costs 3 CP per rank.
