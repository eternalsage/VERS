The Summon ability allows a character to call on another creature for aid. These creatures are friendly to the character although they are typically less powerful. The number of ranks of Summon a character has determine the number of Summoned creatures and their base power level. By default each Summoned creature is an individual and acts on their own (like any other NPC).

Note that a character cannot Summon a creature that is more powerful than he is without GMâ€™s permission. So, if the character was a PL 1, even with 5 ranks he could only Summon a creature with a PL of 0 or 1. Also, a character can mix and match the power levels of their Summons, perhaps Summoning a PL 2 creature and two PL 1 creatures at the same time. This would work identically to the chart for the Clone ability.

With +1 aspect per rank the Summoned creature will appear immediately, such as a fantasy spell, or a sci-fi transporter beam, while a -1 aspect makes the Summoned creature less friendly, requiring negotiation before they will help.

Summon costs 5 CP per rank, and cannot be tied to an attribute.
