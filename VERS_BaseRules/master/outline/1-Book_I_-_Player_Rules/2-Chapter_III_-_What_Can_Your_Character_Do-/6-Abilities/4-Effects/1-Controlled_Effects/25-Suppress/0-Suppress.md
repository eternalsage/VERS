The Suppress ability reduces a target’s capacity to use their abilities, even inherent abilities. This effect is temporary, however, and goes away as soon as the character stops sustaining it. To use this ability, the suppressing character rolls their ranks of Suppress using the target’s Protection (if applicable) as a penalty. If successful, the target of Suppress takes a penalty on the abilities in question equal to the Suppress ranks plus any additions from stunts. This EV either applies as a penalty to the roll to activate the Suppressed ability or reduces the EV of the Suppressed ability if it is already active. Any ability reduced to 0 or less EV is effectively off, however it will automatically reactivate when removing the Suppress effect.

Suppress costs 3 CP per rank.
