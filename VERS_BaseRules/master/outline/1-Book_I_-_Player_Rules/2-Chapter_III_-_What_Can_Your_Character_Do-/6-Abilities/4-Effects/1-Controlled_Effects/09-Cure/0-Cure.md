The Cure ability is able to remove any affliction from a target, whether they are naturally occurring through roleplay or as the result of an Afflict ability. Regardless of the source of the affliction, the Cure ability grants the target an immediate recovery action as well as a bonus on the attempt equal to half the degrees of success. Cure can even resurrect the dead with the GMâ€™s permission in the right type of setting.

Cure costs 3 CP per rank.
