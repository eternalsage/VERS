The Dispel ability removes the effects of other abilities. The successful use of Dispel immediately deactivates the targeted ability, although the target can restart the ability next turn. Dispel can only be used against instant duration (by holding an action) and sustained duration abilities. Dispel is an active roll against the opponentâ€™s ranks in the targeted ability. A successful roll counters or turns off the targeted ability. The targeted ability remains unaffected on a failed roll. Inherent abilities cannot be Dispelled, only Suppressed.

Dispel costs 3 CP per rank.
