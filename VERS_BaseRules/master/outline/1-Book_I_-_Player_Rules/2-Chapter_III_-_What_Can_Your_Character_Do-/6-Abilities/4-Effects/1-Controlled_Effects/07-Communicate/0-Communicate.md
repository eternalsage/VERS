The Communicate ability allows a character to create a direct two-way conversation between two characters that can neither be overheard or interrupted and which does not require proximity to use. This could be a hidden transmitter implanted in the character’s ear, telepathy, or something more exotic. Normally the target of Communicate is a willing target, although this is not a requirement. If used against an unwilling target, treat it as a mental attack.

A character’s ranks in Communicate determine the number of simultaneous connections she can have as well as from how deeply the character can draw the shared information. Assign these ranks when purchased and they cannot be reassigned after creation without GM permission. If the character does not assign any ranks to number of connections she is only able to make one connection at a time. Similarly, if information level has no assigned ranks, she can only share emotional information.

Communicate costs 3 CP per rank, or with GM permission each rank could raise both Connections and Information, and would cost 5 CP per rank.
