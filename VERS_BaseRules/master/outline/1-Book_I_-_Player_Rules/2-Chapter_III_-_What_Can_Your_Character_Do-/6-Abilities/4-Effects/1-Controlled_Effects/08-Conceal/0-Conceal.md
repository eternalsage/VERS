The Conceal ability allows a character to prevent themselves from being perceived by a particular sense (chosen at creation) such as any of the normal senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch, or taste) or a more exotic sense such as infrared vision, ESP, or lie detectors. Use the characterâ€™s ranks in Conceal as a penalty on any Perception skill rolls of the corresponding type. The character must decide to use their ability before the GM calls for a Perception roll. As a sustained ability it takes up a Focus slot while it is active.

Conceal costs 3 CP per rank.
