The Delude ability allows a character to create and maintain the fa√ßade of objects, people, places, or events that do not actually exist or that are not actually happening. The illusions can represent real objects or events or they may be entirely fictitious. These manifestations are real to all mundane senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch), although a character may disbelieve them given circumstances. Delude is mental attack resisted by Perception instead of Discipline, determining if the character sees through or disbelieves the delusion. 

Once the attack is ruled a success and the NDV is determined, the only thing remaining is to apply the appropriate condition. Delude gives Status conditions, which are, in order of least to greatest: Simple, Minor, Major, and Extreme. In all cases the target believes the illusion until the ability user stops sustaining it or they interact with it in a way that proves it is not real. The effect begins as soon as the attack roll is successful and ends as soon as the user stops focusing on it. If the player adds the Instant aspect, the only way to remove the effect is through conventional (roleplaying) means or the Cure ability.

- **Simple:** The Simple condition applies if the NDV is between 0 and 2. These are small illusion such as the sound of a footstep outside or something moving out of the corner of their eye.

- **Minor:** The Minor condition applies when the NDV is between 3-5. This is the type of illusion that includes changing small details, such as masking the writing on paper, making a neutral person view you as an ally, or disguising an item as something else.

- **Major:** The Major condition applies when the NDV is between 6 & 8. An illusion at this level would be like changing your looks to someone else, masking the presence of a creature, or creating the illusion of a person than can speak.

- **Extreme:** This condition applies when the NDV is greater than 9. An illusion on this level would be something like the illusion of a creature attacking the city, or of a whole host of warriors.

Delude costs 3 CP per rank.
