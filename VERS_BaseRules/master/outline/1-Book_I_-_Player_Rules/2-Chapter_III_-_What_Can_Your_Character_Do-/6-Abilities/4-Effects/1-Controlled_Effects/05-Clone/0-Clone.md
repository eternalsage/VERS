The Clone ability allows a character to create an exact physical replica of himself. These clones are physically identical in appearance to the original although they are typically less powerful. The number of ranks in Clone determines the number of clones and their base power level.

By default each clone is an individual and acts on their own, although they share the same personality and experience up to the moment of their creation. Note that a character cannot make a clone that is more powerful than himself. If the character is PL1, even if his GM were to give permission for him to take 5 ranks of Clone, he could still only create a clone with a PL of 0 or 1, although he would be able to create the larger numbers of these lower powered clones allowed by such a high rank. Also, a character can mix and match the power levels of their clones. In this case, always start with the most powerful clone that a character wants to create and work down using the simple equation of a clone PL is equal to 2 of the next PL down (A 5 is worth two 4s, each of which is worth two 3s, etc).

For +1 CP per rank the creating character has full control over their clones, sharing senses and all experiences with them even after creation. A -1 CP per level makes each clone unique with their own personality, usually exaggerating a small part of the creatorâ€™s overarching personality, making them even less controllable or predictable.

Clone costs 5 CP per rank, and cannot be tied to an attribute.
