The Desolidify ability allows a character to change into various other states of matter, some of them fictional. Desolidify could also be used as an attack to change others instead, although note that all the advantages of the new forms are given to the victims as well. Each rank of Desolidify represents a new dimension to the ability. A character must choose at ability creation what substance their Desolidification resembles (liquid metal, water, mist, light, ghosts, etc). This cannot be changed after ability creation. Unlike most other abilities, having higher ranks does not give access to lower ranks without GM permission. Instead the higher ranks balance the costs with the increased advantages of the more powerful types.

One rank makes a character mostly solid, but she can reform body parts into new shapes, move through gaps normally too small for a human, and gets a +1 bonus to Protection and uses of Deception to impersonate others. In this form the character no longer needs food.

Rank two allows a character to become fully liquid. In this state they can pour through any non-waterproof gap, cannot be physically damaged nor can they physically attack someone else, and are more prone to freezing in extreme temperatures. Similarly, rank three allows a character to become a gas, able to move through even the tiniest gaps, move through the air, and are similarly unable to attack or be attacked physically, although fans or the wind may disperse them for a time. In either of these forms the character no longer needs sleep, food, or water.

Four ranks of Desolidify allows a character to become pure energy, such as living electricity, light, or even sound waves. Determine this form when the ability is first created; it cannot be changed thereafter. Also note that while most energy can move at extreme speeds and even through some solid surfaces, energy is also somewhat easily constrained. For example, rubber or glass are effective against electricity, as are specially designed Faraday meshes and cages. Light can pass through any transparent surface but a room with no windows is an inescapable trap. In this form the character no longer requires sleep, food, or water, but can only exist in mediums that the energy type could exist in (such as sound cannot exist in a vacuum).

At rank five, the Desolidified character no longer reacts to normal physics, passing through objects as if the strong and weak nuclear forces no longer affects them at all. Physical attacks are completely ineffectual against the character although the character is also completely incapable of attacking or interacting with physical objects themselves. In this form the character no longer requires sleep, air, food, or water.

Desolidify costs 5 CP per rank, and cannot be tied to an attribute.
