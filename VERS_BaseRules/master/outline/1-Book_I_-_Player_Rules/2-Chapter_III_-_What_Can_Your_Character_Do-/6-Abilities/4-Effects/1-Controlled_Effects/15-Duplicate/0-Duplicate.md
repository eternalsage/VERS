The Duplicate ability allows a character to directly copy another characterâ€™s ability. A Duplicated ability acts just like the original, with all the same manifestations although changing the color or have another distinguishing characteristic could fit the flavor of the setting or the ability. Each rank of Duplicate goes into a Duplication Pool. A character can allocate ranks from the pool to directly copy any or all abilities that a touched character has. The character does not have to allocate the same number of ranks of the ability as the target. Allocating a single rank gives the character the ability, albeit possibly a weaker version.

Each copied ability takes up a Focus slot, which does not count toward using any sustained abilities, either that the character has natively or that the character has copied from a target. For instance, if a character has only one Focus slot available and she Duplicates an ability based on the Suppress effect, that Duplicated ability takes up her Focus slot. This would leave her without a slot to actually use the ability until she drops some other sustained ability to make room.

Duplicate costs 3 CP per rank, and cannot be tied to an attribute.
