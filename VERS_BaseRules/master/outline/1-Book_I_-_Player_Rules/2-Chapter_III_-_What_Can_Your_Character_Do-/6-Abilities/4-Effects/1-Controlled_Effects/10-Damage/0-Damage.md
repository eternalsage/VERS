The Damage ability is the primary method for harming a target. It can give Injuries, Focus, or Morale conditions. When doing physical damage, it is important to remember the trade off between damage and defense. Damage abilities that do not rely on muscle power to wound (guns, laser swords, plasma torches, etc) do not get the benefit of Strength, however the opponent also does not get the benefit of using Dodge to defend, instead using the lesser of Agility or Intuition. Both cases can get bonus EV from stunts depending on rolls.

Damage costs 3 CP per rank.
