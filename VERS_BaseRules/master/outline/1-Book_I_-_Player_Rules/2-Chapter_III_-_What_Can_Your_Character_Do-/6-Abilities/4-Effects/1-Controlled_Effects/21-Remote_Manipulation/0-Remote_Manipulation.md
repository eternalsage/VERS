The Remote Manipulation ability enables a character to move objects without physically interacting with them. A character can use Remote Manipulation to catch and throw objects, lift them, push them, or even crush them. Manipulate Object is also able to perform direct attacks such as a long distance punch or kick.

Remote Manipulation has both a Strength rank and an Agility rank, both independent of the character's attributes of the same name, although if the ability is tied to an attribute it should be a power attribute and gives a number of free ranks that can be assigned to either category. Once assigned these attributes can only be changed with GMâ€™s permission.

Manipulate Object costs 2 CP per rank.
