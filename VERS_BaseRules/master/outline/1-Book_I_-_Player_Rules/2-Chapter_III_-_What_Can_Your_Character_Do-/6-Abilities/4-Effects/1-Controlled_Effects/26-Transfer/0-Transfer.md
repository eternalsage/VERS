The Transfer ability allows a character to reduce one attribute or skill by up to the EV and increase another by the same amount. The affected attributes do not have to belong to the same character, although the player sets the target attributes or skills at creation. In other words, you can Transfer from a target to yourself, yourself to a target, between two different targets, or even between two different attributes of your own, but this can only be decided when creating the ability, and cannot be changed later.

Transfer costs 3 CP per rank and cannot be tied to an attribute.
