The Prophecy ability enables a character to have prophetic visions of possible future events. There are two ways to use this ability: passively allowing the visions to come as they will (as the GM deems them dramatically appropriate), or the more aggressive methods of actively seeking answers directly. Passive visions most often occur when running across new information or people. Typically this type of vision takes the form of a flash of insight (“this person seems important”) although anything the GM finds appropriate but vague will work. A character can also go into a Meditative state (succeed on a passive Meditation roll with full Focus) and hope that an insight will come to them. In this state the GM may decide to give a hint to get the character on the right track, or point them to a plot point they may have missed. This information should be vague but useful.

The more aggressive use of Prophecy is to actively attempt to force the future to reveal itself. This also involves a Meditative state, but the difference is that the character has a specific focus. The player makes a passive Meditation + Prophecy roll with a penalty equal to any Focus damage they currently have (or any potential environmental Focus damage, such as distractions, etc). The DR for this roll has a base of 5, plus any additional for specificity. On a success they may ask a number of direct questions equal to the Degrees of Success to the GM that the GM must answer (although cryptic vagueness is encouraged). Failure does an amount of Focus damage equal to the ranks in Prophecy and the Degrees of Failure. Depending on the setting the GM may also give the player a temporary psychological Flaw.

Prophecy costs 5 CP per rank.
