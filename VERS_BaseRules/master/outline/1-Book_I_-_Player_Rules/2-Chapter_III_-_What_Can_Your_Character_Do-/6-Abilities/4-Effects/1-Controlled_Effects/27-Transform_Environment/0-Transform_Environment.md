The Transform Environment ability allows a character to alter the environment around them, changing solid ground into quicksand, turning a fallow field verdant and green, and calling up a thunderstorm on a sunny cloudless day. These changes are on a large-scale, affecting a circular area with a diameter of 64m at the smallest.

Once the roll is ruled a success and the NDV is determined, the only thing remaining is to apply the appropriate condition. Like most other transforming effects, Transform Environment relies on the standard four tiered condition hierarchy. Unlike normal, however, the environment does not have a condition tracker. The tiers are simply used to determine the magnitude of the effect based on the EV. These tiers are, in order of least to greatest: Simple, Minor, Major, and Extreme. In all cases these transformations are real changes, not illusions (that would be Delude).

- **Simple:** The Simple condition applies if the NDV is between 0 and 2. These are small changes such as changing the color of a building, making all the grass in a field faintly glow (however, too dim to offset darkness penalties), or filling the air with a pleasant fragrance.

- **Minor:** The Minor condition applies when the NDV is between 3-5. This is the type of transformation that can give bonuses and penalties (only 1 or 2 ranks), and includes things like filling an area with a terrible stench, turning a cloudless sky cloudy, creating a dim light, or changing salty water drinkable.

- **Major:** The Major condition applies when the NDV is between 6 & 8. This would be a transformation that would offer greater bonuses or penalties (as much as 4 ranks) or are otherwise much more impressive. Examples include filling an area with tear-gas, turning a clear sky into a storm, making a bright light, or making polluted water drinkable.

- **Extreme:** This condition applies when the NDV is greater than 9. This is a transformation that can grant tremendous bonuses or penalties (up to 6 ranks) or are otherwise awe inspiring. Examples would be filling the air with a mind control agent that turns foes into allies, summoning a tornado, creating a blinding flash over an entire battlefield, or changing water into a deadly poison.

Transform Environment costs 5 CP per rank.
