The Command ability allows a character to plant suggestions in another’s mind, or even completely control their actions. This could be described as a form of hypnotism, a drug-induced weakened mental state, or even a magical geas that compels the hero to action against his will. No matter the form it takes, Command is a mainstay of fiction.

Once the attack is ruled a success and the NDV is determined, the only thing remaining is to apply the appropriate condition. Command gives Status conditions, which are, in order of least to greatest: Simple, Minor, Major, and Extreme. In all cases these commands only last as long as the primary character sustains the ability. The effect begins as soon as the attack roll is successful and ends as soon as the user stops focusing on it. If the player adds the Instant aspect, the only way to remove the effect is through conventional (roleplaying) means or the Cure ability.

- **Simple:** The Simple condition applies if the NDV is between 0 and 2. These are small commands such as "smile" or "set aside" that would not make a difference to the target. In other words, they would suffer no ill effects from complying.

- **Minor:** The Minor condition applies when the NDV is between 3-5. These are like encouragements goading a victim into actions they were already predisposed to, like getting the aggressive guy to throw the first punch in a brawl, or the parolee to commit another crime. Any actions that are against the victim’s better judgment but in line with their flaws, concept, or not going to harm them in any obvious way also fall in this category.

- **Major:** The Major condition applies when the NDV is between 6 & 8. A command on this level would be any actions that are obviously going to hurt the character’s interests like getting someone to embezzle funds and leave an obvious trail, or start a fist fight with a police officer. At this level the character will not actively harm themselves or those they love but they may act carelessly in such a way that the consequences of their actions end up harming them indirectly.

- **Extreme:** This condition applies when the NDV is greater than 9. Extreme uses of Command would entail any actions that will directly harm or even kill themselves or their loved ones, such as driving them to commit suicide or to set a bomb in their house while their children slept. There is no question, an extreme action will hurt or kill themselves or those dear to them.

Command costs 3 CP per rank.
