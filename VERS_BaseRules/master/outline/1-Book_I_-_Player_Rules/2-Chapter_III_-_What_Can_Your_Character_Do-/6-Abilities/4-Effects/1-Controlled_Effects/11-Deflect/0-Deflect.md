The Deflect ability allows a character to anticipate the actions of an attacker and block the attack with weapon or even a part of the body. With enough degrees of success (and an attack ability that makes sense) the character can even reflect the attack back at the attack.

To use Deflect the character must hold their action to actively defend. When actively defending against muscle-powered attacks the character adds his ranks of Deflect as a modifier to his Parry. Deflect even allows the defender to deflect non-muscle powered attacks such as gunshots, but they still do not get their Parry skill on the attempt. Once the ranged attack is declared the defender rolls their modified competence, with success meaning that the attack was deflected in a random direction, see the following chart, and can strike anyone in those directions as appropriate. With five or more Degrees of Success the defender can aim the deflected attack as he desires.

Deflect costs 2 CP per rank, and cannot be tied to an attribute.
