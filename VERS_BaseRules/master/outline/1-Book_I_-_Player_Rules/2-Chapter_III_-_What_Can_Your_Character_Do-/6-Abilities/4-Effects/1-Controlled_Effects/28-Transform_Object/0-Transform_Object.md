The Transform Object ability lets a character turn one thing into another thing, such as lead into gold or even a box of parts into a working radio. This change must have a way to undo it (such as another Transform Object ability to turn gold into lead, or disassembling the radio back into a box of parts).

Once the roll is ruled a success and the NDV is determined, the only thing remaining is to apply the appropriate condition. Like most other transforming effects, Transform Environment relies on the standard four tiered condition hierarchy. These tiers are, in order of least to greatest: Simple, Minor, Major, and Extreme. In all cases these transformations are real changes, not illusions (that would be Delude).

- **Simple:** The Simple condition applies if the NDV is between 0 and 2. These are small changes such as changing the color of something, change its flavor, or similar purely cosmetic change.

**Minor:** The Minor condition applies when the NDV is between 3-5. This is the type of transformation that can give bonuses and penalties (only 1 or 2 ranks), and includes things making a sword sharper, making a material transparent, making it emit light, or mending a whole in an item.

- **Major:** The Major condition applies when the NDV is between 6 & 8. This would be a transformation that would offer greater bonuses or penalties (as much as 4 ranks) or are otherwise much more impressive. Examples include drastically changing an items shape, removing impurities from base ore, or changing an animal into a different kind of animal.

- **Extreme:** This condition applies when the NDV is greater than 9. This is a transformation that can grant tremendous bonuses or penalties (up to 6 ranks) or are otherwise awe inspiring. Examples would be changing a person into a tree, lead into gold, or making a gorilla as intelligent as a human.

Transform Object costs 5 CP per rank.
