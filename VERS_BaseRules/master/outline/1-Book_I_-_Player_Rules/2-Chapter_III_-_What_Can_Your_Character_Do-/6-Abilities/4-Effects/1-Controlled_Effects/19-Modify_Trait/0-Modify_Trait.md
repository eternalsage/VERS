The Modify Trait ability enables a character to increase or decrease an attribute or skill temporarily, including Size. Modify Trait can only affect one attribute or skill, chosen at creation. Changing multiple attributes or skills with a single ability requires a +0.5 Aspect per additional attribute or skill. Upon successful use increase or decrease the targeted skill or attribute by half the Effect Value, although the character is never required to use the full EV if they do not want to.

Modify Trait costs 3 CP per rank.
