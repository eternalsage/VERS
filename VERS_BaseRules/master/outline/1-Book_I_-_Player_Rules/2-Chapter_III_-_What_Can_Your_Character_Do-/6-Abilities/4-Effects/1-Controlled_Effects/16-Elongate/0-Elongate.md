The Elongate ability allows a character to enhance his reach, height, etc, without changing his Size. Whether this is because a dense plasticity material makes up his body or because he has extensible cyborg arms, each rank of Elongate allows for an additional rank of height (distance) or a +1 to reach. Players can mix and match these bonuses, for example, using 3 ranks of Elongate to get a +2 to reach and a +1 to height. This bonus can also be used as a bonus to Grapple, either to maintain or to escape a grapple. These bonuses can also be switched or altered as a free action and the character is under no obligation to use all any or all of their ranks at any one time. Also note that a character’s Size, mass, and density do not change using this power, he only alters the configuration of his body. At GM’s discretion the character may use Elongate to change the proportions of the rest of their body as well, such as forming a sail or similar.

Elongate costs 2 points per rank.
