The Shield ability allows one character to intercede and protect another. This could take the form of a physical shield, a wall of ice, or the energy shields on a starship. Shields have two separate components: Area and Hardness, and they take Damage conditions as an object. In essence, they are a summoned object that interposes between the character and his attackers. These components can be set at the time of use, each rank of EV able to be placed in one category or the other.

Shield costs 2 CP per rank.
