An instant or sustained ability can ignore objects intervening between the user and the target. The effect may go around the intervening obstacle (like a flail or rope weapon) or may simply go through it (like a sci-fi weapon that passes through solid matter). Regardless, the effect is the same and the ability halves cover penalties. Indirect is a positive aspect, with an adjustment modifier of +0.5.

Indirect is useful for the above concepts, as well as for spells that call down lightning or superhero powers that raise sharp spike of stones from the ground.
