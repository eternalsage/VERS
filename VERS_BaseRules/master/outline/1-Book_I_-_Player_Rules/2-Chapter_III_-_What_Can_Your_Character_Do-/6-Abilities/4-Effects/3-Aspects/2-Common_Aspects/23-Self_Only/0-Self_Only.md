An instant or sustained ability is only usable on the user. By default all instant and sustained abilities can target either the ability’s user or a touched target. Self only is a negative aspect, with an adjustment modifier or -0.5.

Self only is useful for creating personal concealment cloaks, a paladin’s ability to purge himself of curses and disease, or a ritual that grants the caster extreme strength.
