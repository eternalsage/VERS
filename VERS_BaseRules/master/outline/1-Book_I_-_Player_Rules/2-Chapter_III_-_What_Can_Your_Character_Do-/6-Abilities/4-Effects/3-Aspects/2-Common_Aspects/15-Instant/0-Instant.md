A sustained ability that is only in effect for a split second as opposed to being sustained over multiple Turns. These abilities do not take up Focus slots, and thus deactivate immediately after being activated. Instant is a negative aspect, with an adjustment modifier of -0.5.

Instant is useful for creating cheap magical trinkets or experimental technology.
