An instant or sustained ability requires certain movements for activation. Simple movements like raising an arm, or complex movements like making certain yoga poses are equally valid, and requires a description at creation. Anything that prevents the movements prevents the functioning of the ability. Requires Movement is a negative aspect, with an adjustment modifier of -0.5.

Requires Movement is useful for making wizard spells which require certain gestures to cast, or with esoteric Buddhist rituals that require a complex chain of detailed and exact finger movements.
