An ability affects more than just one target. If used with Long Range the additional targets need not be adjacent or otherwise grouped together, as long as each is within sight (or other targeting sense). Each rank doubles the number of affected targets. Multiple Targets is a positive aspect, with an adjustment modifier of +0.5 per rank.

Multiple Targets is useful for making an Affliction that curses every person who disturbed the mummy’s sleep, a magic spell that doesn’t affect innocents, or a salvo of smart missiles.
