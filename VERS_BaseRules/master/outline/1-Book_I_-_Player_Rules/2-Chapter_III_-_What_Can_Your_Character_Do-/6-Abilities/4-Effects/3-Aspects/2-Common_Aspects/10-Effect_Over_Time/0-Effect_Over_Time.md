An instant or inherent ability becomes a sustained ability, applying its EV every turn as long as the character sustains the ability. Effect Over Time abilities take up a Focus slot just like a normal sustained ability. This automatic effect occurs at the start of the user’s turn. Effect Over Time does not affect the initial attack, however, on subsequent turns the EV is applied again without need for additional attack rolls. This effect does still benefit from any stunts earned on the initial roll. Similarly, the ability does still have to penetrate the target’s Protection each turn to get any effect. Effect Over Time is a positive aspect, with an adjustment modifier of +2.

Active is useful for creating things like tear gas grenades, sticky magma or napalm blasts, and airborne pathogens.
