An instant or sustained ability requires certain vocalizations to activate, either actual words with meaning or nonsensical ramblings (the nature of which must be determined at creation). If the user cannot speak then the ability does not work. Requires Speech is a negative aspect, with an adjustment modifier of -0.5.

Requires Speech is useful for creating magic spells that require incantations in an ancient tongue, or for activating the powerful A.I. controlled guns of a star cruiser.
