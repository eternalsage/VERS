The rule of thumb is that if a feature of an ability is both mechanically effective and intended to happen on a regular basis then the player should pay for the aspects, while non-mechanical effects like color or one-off tricks that may only happen once are properties. For example, if the player wants her lightning spell to always stun her enemies like a taser then she should pay for it with aspects. On the other hand if she remembers that tasers run on electricity in the middle of a fight with an enemy that might only be beaten by paralyzing him would be ruled as a stunt based on the property of her ability.
