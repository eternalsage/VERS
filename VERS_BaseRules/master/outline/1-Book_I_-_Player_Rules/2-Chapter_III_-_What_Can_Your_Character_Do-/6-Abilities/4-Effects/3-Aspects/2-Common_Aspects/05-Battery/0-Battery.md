A sustained ability uses an external power source instead of Focus to operate. This external source of power must have some method of renewing or restoring its charge, such as a literal recharging, filling up the gas tank, or reloading the magazine. Each rank of this aspect doubles the turns the ability is active. Battery is a positive aspect, with an adjustment modifier of +0.5 per rank.

Battery is useful for creating futuristic weapons with charge packs, electronic devices and motorized machines that use fuel.
