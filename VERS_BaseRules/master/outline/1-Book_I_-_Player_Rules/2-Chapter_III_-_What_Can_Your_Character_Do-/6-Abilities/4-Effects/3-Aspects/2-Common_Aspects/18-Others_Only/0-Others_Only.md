An instant or sustained ability is only usable on others and not the user. By default all instant and sustained abilities can target either. Others only is a negative aspect, with an adjustment modifier or -0.5.

Others only is useful for creating a priest’s ability to heal others with a touch, or a doctor’s ability to operate on others but not himself.
