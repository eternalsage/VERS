An instant or sustained ability becomes a ranged ability (all abilities start as close range). It is important to note that this aspect has no effect on Damage and Stun effects. They have an automatic trade off between additional damage and ability to be dodged that is intrinsic to them. Ranged is a positive aspect, with an adjustment modifier of +0.5.

Ranged is useful for creating a clericâ€™s ability to heal teammates from across the room, or for a device to erase a hard-drive from down the hall.
