The EV of an ablative ability reduces with each use. Typically this is -1 per use, but more is possible by applying the Aspect multiple times. Ablative must always have some way to return the ability to its original status, such as a recharge time or other such. Ablative is a negative aspect, with an adjustment modifier of -0.5. Ablative can only be applied to Sustained or Inherent abilities.

Ablative is useful for creating sci-fi protection shields, armor cobbled together from miscellaneous items, and weapons that lose their power quickly.
