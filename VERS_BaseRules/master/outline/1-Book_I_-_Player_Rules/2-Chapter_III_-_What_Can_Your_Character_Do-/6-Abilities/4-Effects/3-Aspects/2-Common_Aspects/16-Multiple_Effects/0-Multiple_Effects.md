An ability is not bound to a single effect from creation but are instead used to create several different effects. These effects are still chosen at ability creation, and cannot be changed. Multiple Effects is a positive Aspect, with an adjustment modifier of +0.5.

Multiple Effects is good for creating a potion that increases Strength and Agility, a scope that can give thermal vision as well as zoom in, or a spell that summons multiple monsters at the same time.
