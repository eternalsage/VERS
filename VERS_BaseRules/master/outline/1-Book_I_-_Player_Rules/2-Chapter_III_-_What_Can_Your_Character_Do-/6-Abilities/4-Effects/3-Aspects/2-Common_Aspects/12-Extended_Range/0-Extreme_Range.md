An instant or sustained ability is able to target foes at any distance from the user, not just line of sight. The actual limit of Extreme Range is up to the GM and the genre and tone of the game in question, perhaps being anywhere in the city, the country, the hemisphere, etc. Extreme Range does not allow an ability to ignore cover however, and any bullet, ray, etc must travel to the target in the most straightforward path possible, be it a straight line, a ballistic arc, or some type of complex orbital maneuver. Also note that the attack must still be aimed, usually via some sort of extra sense or technology. Extreme range is a positive aspect, with an adjustment modifier of +0.5.

Extreme Range is useful for creating long-range missiles, scrying spells, and clairvoyance.
