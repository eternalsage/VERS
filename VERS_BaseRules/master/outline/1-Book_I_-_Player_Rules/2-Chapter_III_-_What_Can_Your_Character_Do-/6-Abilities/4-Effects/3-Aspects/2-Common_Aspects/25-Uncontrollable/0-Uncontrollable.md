An instant or sustained ability is outside the character’s control, turning on or off at the GM’s discretion. Sustained abilities activated this way are also deactivated this way, unless the ability due to lost Focus. Uncontrollable is a negative aspect, with an adjustment modifier of -2.

Uncontrollable is useful for creating a psychic’s ability to pick up random bursts of insight, or a character’s transformation into a hideous monster at random intervals.
