An instant ability uses an external source of power to function and once depleted the ability no longer functions until recharged. All abilities with the charges aspect must have a way of recovering used charges, whether that is refilling the magazine, recharging a battery, buying new arrows, or something completely different. Each rank of the charges aspect reduces the number of uses the ability has before it is out. For more information, see the chart below. Charges is a negative aspect with an adjustment modifier of -0.5 per rank.

Charges is useful for creating firearms, grenade bandoliers, quivers of arrows, and similar abilities.
