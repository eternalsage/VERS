A character activates an instant or sustained ability as normal, but the effect of the ability is not seen until the user choices. This ability is only available within a frame of time determined by the ranks of the aspect or go into effect automatically or become inert, as is appropriate to the concept. Each rank of delay adds an additional rank of time before the effect begins. Delay is a positive aspect, with an adjustment modifier of +0.5 per rank.

Delay is useful for abilities like potions and bombs.
