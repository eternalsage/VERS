An instant or sustained ability affects everyone within a certain area. Determine the affected area based on the EV of the ability and the shape of the area in question (line, cone, or sphere). Area of Effect is only for ranged attacks unless the GM allows otherwise. Area of Effect does suffer a fall-off effect which means that the ability is most effective in the center (or origin, in the case of cones and lines) and radiates outward losing force as it travels. Treat the EV as 1 rank less per each rank of distance from the origin it travels. Area of Effect is a positive aspect, with an adjustment modifier of +1.

Area of Effect is useful for creating mutagenic bioweapon gases, fireball spells, bombs, and mass hypnosis spells.
