An ability works when and only when meeting certain conditions. The character still has control over the ability and can choose to activate it or not, however it only works if conditions are right. Conditional is a negative aspect, with an adjustment modifier of -0.5.

Conditional is useful for creating an ability that turns a character into a werewolf during a full moon, or for abilities that said werewolf only has during the change, such as claws and enhanced scent.
