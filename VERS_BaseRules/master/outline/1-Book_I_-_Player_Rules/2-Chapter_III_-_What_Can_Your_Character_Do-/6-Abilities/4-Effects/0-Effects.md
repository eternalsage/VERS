Manifestations tell how an ability looks, and Properties tell where it comes from, but the Effect tells how it works, explaining in VERS mechanics what the user has to do to use the ability and how it affects the target.

Effects fall within two broad subtypes, Controlled and Inherent. Controlled effects only occur when the player chooses to use them, their duration is either Instant or Sustained, and these abilities are subject to both Dispel and Suppress effects.

On the other hand, Inherent effects are simply on all the time because they are intrinsic to the character, like enhanced senses or gills. Inherent effects are not activated and cannot be Dispelled, although Suppress can affect them, reducing their effect or turning them off temporarily. Ranks purchased in inherent effects just add to the overall ranks in that ability, much like ranks in an attribute.
