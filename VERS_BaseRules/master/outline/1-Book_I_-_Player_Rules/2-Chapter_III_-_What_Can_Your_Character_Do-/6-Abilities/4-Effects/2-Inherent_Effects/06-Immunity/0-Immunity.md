The Immunity ability makes a character impervious to effects of a certain type or afflictions of a certain severity. Unlike other types of defenses (Protection and Shield) a character with Immunity is completely unaffected by the specific effect, regardless of the EV. However, an Immunity is also extremely narrow, like fire, bladed weapons, or UV light, unlike Protection and Shield which protect from all damage sources equally.

Immunity costs 2 CP per rank, and cannot be tied to an attribute.
