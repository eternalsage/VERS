The Extra Limbs ability allows a character to have more limbs than normal, based on the chart. These limbs can act as legs (not very articulated), arms (more articulation, more finesse), or even tails or tentacles with dozen's of points of articulation, player's choice when creating the ability. A character doesnâ€™t have to use all the limb slots available to them from their ranks.

Extra Limbs cost 2 points per rank, and cannot be tied to an attribute.
