The Sense ability allows characters to have super keen standard senses or to create senses that otherwise donâ€™t exist (like the ability to Sense auras or see ghosts). Both types of Sense abilities rely on the Perception skill to function and add their ranks to it when making a Perception roll with the corresponding sense.

An existing Sense serves as the basis for most new Senses, especially when determining function, range, and accuracy. Note that just because a new Sense is similar to an existing Sense, the bonuses are not interchangeable. X-Ray vision does not get the bonuses from Sense (Vision) and vice versa. New Senses are either Targeting or Indirect. Targeting Senses work like vision and hearing, and can accurately find and track stimuli. However, Indirect Senses like smell pick up stimuli in the surrounding area, but cannot quickly and accurately find and track them. Thus, indirect senses cannot be used to make attacks, while direct senses can.

The cost of Sense depends on the type of sense purchased. Standard senses (to humans) cost 1 CP per rank, Exotic senses (non-human, but exist in nature) cost 2 CP per rank, and purely supernatural senses (do not exist to our knowledge) cost 3 CP per rank. Sense cannot be tied to an attribute, however it factors into the Perception skill roll.
