The Absorption ability allows a character to turn damage into a bonus to an attribute or skill. The maximum bonus from Absorption is twice the starting value of the attribute. For example, a character with a Strength of 4 can only increase up to an 8 with Absorption. Absorption only applies to Injury, Focus, or Morale, chosen at creation, and can only increase one attribute or skill (also chosen at creation) without an aspect.

Absorption is a reaction that is triggered by attacks with a positive, non-zero NDV. When the player suffers this attack, apply the ranks of Absorption as a second Resistance Value and increase the related skill or attribute by 1 rank. Any NDV left after this is applied as normal. These bonus ranks remain until the end of the Scene.

Absorption costs 5 CP per rank, and cannot be tied to an attribute.
