The Movement ability enhances inherent movement types (running for land creatures, flying for birds and bats, and swimming for sea creatures) or creates new, more exotic types of Movement like teleportation, wall-climbing, or web-swinging. In combat, Movement ranks are simply added to the character’s base Movement rate (if it is a standard movement type. Outside of combat or during chase scenes, these ranks are added to the character’s Athletics roll. In the case of new or exotic movement types there is no default Movement rate so the total Movement rank is equal to the total ranks in that ability. While it does not change the cost, think of standard movements as what a normal human can do, exotic as something other natural creatures do, and  supernatural as something completely new.

The cost of Movement depends on the type of movement. Standard movement types (to humans) cost 1 CP per rank, Exotic movement types (non-human, but exists in nature) cost 2 CP per rank, and purely supernatural movement types (do not exist at all, to our knowledge) cost 3 CP per rank. Movement cannot be tied to an attribute, however it factors into the movement determination formula.
