The Speed ability allows a character to perform more actions than normal in a turn by giving the character a buffer against the penalties for taking additional actions. For each rank of Speed, the character can ignore 2 points of penalties for taking extra actions in a turn. In other words, with 1 rank, taking an added action gives a -1 penalty instead of a -3. At 2 ranks the first extra action is without penalty, but the second is at a -1 instead of the -6 that would be normal.

Speed costs 5 CP per rank, and cannot be tied to an attribute.
