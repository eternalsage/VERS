The Enhanced Attribute ability lets a character purchase ranks of an attribute with aspects. However, the Suppress ability can affect these additional attribute ranks, while traditional attribute ranks cannot. Enhanced Attributes also may have other drawbacks based on the manifestation and properties chosen for the ability.

Enhanced Attribute costs 3 CP per rank, and cannot be tied to an attribute.
