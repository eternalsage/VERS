The Regeneration ability allows a character to increase the rate at which he heals wounds naturally. This does not include regrowing limbs and the like by default, although with the GMs permission Regeneration can do so for +1 aspect.

Regeneration costs 3 CP per rank, and cannot be tied to an attribute.
