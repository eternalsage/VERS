The Protection ability prevents damage and other effects from harming the character. It can only protect one attribute, skill, ability, etc at a time, chosen at character creation. Ranks in Protection are added to the associated resistance trait (if there is one) to form the Resistance Value (RV) against an attack or ability use.

Protection costs 2 CP per rank, and cannot be tied to an attribute, but is already factored into the Resistance Value of a character with the ability.
