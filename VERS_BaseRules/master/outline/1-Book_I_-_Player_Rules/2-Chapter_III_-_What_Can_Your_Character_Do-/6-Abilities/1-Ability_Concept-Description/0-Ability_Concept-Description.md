The Ability Concept (or Ability Description) is the most important part of the ability to the player, it describes in plain english what both the player and character can expect from the ability. Examples would be:

*“Searing heat and a faint ozone smell permeate the air as a bright flash of lightning strikes the foe from the caster’s hands. Deals damage equal to ranks to a single target.”*

This example sets up both what the character needs to know (you shoot lightning bolts, they are hot, bright, and smell of ozone) and what the player needs to know (they come from the hands, they deal damage equal to the purchased ranks). When creating the ability we often refer to this as a concept and it helps us to build it. When the ability appears on a list to be chosen from it is generally referred to as an ability description.
