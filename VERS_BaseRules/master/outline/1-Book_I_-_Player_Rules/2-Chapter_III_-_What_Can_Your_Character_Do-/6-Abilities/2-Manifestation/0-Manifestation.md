Every ability has a Manifestation that tells what it looks, sounds, smells, tastes, or feels like. Most abilities will have multiple components to their manifestation because characters can sense them in a multitude of ways. However, every ability must have at least one manifestation. This manifestation should include one of the five major senses, but with GM discretion can include more esoteric senses like aura reading or sonar. Most ability concepts will spell out exactly what the manifestation looks like, many of them in the name of the ability itself. Most people have an idea of what a “fireball,” “lightning bolt,” or “angel wings” look like, after all.
