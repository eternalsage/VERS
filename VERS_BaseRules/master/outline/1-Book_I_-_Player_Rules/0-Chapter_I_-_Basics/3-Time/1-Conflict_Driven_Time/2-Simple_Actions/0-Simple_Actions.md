  - **Speaking a sentence:** A character can speak a sentence as a simple action, such as “Sven, he’s behind the wood pile!,” “I think that sound is getting louder,” or “Where did he go?” At the GM’s discretion the speaking character may speak while performing another action, such as speaking while moving, but characters can’t spout out philosophical debates in the middle of combat for free.
  
  - **Tossing/catching an item:** Throwing an item to another character or into a specific place is a simple action, as is catching a thrown item. The character must have the item in hand and free of any restraints in order to throw it as a simple action.
  
  - **Moving:** Each character has a movement ability determined by her attributes (typically 5 + Agility + Size + Athletics, but advantages can change this). A character can move this distance as a simple action. The character can combine movement with another action by taking a -2 penalty to the combined action.
  
  - **Making an attack:** A character can make a single attack as a simple action on any character or object within her reach (including the reach or range of her weapon).
  
- **Using a potion/taking a pill:** A character may take a drink, a single bite, or place an object in their mouth as a simple action. This includes swallowing.

  - **Making simple hand signs:** While a character can understand hand signals as a free action, making them is a bit more complex, with simple phrases/ ideas taking a simple action. For examples of simple phrases, see “speak a phrase” above.
  
  - **Readying a prepared item:** A character may draw a weapon from a holster/scabbard, or another object from a similarly convenient carrying solution such as a bandolier of potions.
