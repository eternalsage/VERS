  - **Speaking a phrase:** Speaking a word or short phrase aloud, such as “Stop,” “Hands Up!,” “Halt!,” or “Surprise!” would be a free action. Complete sentences and the like are not free actions.
  
  - **Dropping an item:** A character can drop any item in her hands as a free action. The character can not drop  a strapped, tethered, or tied item, and a dropped item cannot be aimed or directed.
  
  - **Taking a step:** A character may take a single step (on average about 1 meter of movement for an adult human), but only if they make no other movement on their turn.
  
  - **Swallowing:** If a character has an object in his mouth he may swallow it as a free action.
  
  - **Interpreting hand signs:** If someone is communicating through gestures in a system the character understands then it is a free action to get the message. Common gesture systems are sign language and military signals, both of which come in numerous varieties just like spoken language. Both the interpreting character and the character making the gestures need knowledge of the same communication system for communication to happen.
