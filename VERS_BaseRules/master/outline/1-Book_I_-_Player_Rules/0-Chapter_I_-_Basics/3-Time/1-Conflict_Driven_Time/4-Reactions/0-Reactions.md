- **Dodging or blocking an attack:** Anytime a character uses Dodge, Discipline or the Parry skill to protect themselves from an attack or environmental hazard this is a reaction.

- **Activating a defensive advantage or ability:** These three abilities, as well as any others built with the Reactive aspect can be used as a reaction.

- **Make any type of opposed roll against another character:** Anytime a character attempts to thwart anotherâ€™s skill use with an opposed roll, this opposed roll is a reaction.
