- **Speaking a simple paragraph:** For communicating more complex ideas such as “I know you have a good heart! Don’t let your rage and frustration consume you!” or “I’m giving you a final chance. Put down your weapon and back away!” This still does not allow you to deliver a Shakespearean monologue.

- **Making a double move:** A character may move twice their normal movement distance as a complex action. This is equivalent to “hustling” or “double timing it,” and is the quickest a normal character can move without taking losing the ability to defend themselves. A character can move four times their normal move speed outside of combat, but they have no active defense.

- **Making a full-out attack:** A character can make two attacks (such as a shield bash followed by a sword swipe, swinging with two weapons, or just making two punches) against any target in reach or they may make a single more powerful attack that grants a +4 bonus to their damage.

- **Making complex hand signs:** A character can convey more complex concepts via hand signs as a complex action. For examples, see “speaking a sentence” above. A character wishing to convey more complex information must be out of combat.

- **Retrieving a stored item:** A character may retrieve a stored item from a pouch or pack as a complex action. A pack that contains a large quantity of items may take longer. Rummaging through a large storage device like a chest is an out of combat action.
