All rolls fall into three broad categories: active, passive, and reactive. This division is based on two principles. First, who is initiating the action, the player or the GM? If the player is initiating the action it is either an active or passive action. If an NPC or the environment is initiating the action towards a character it is a reaction. Player actions initiated towards NPCs are active, which means they are actively resisted by the NPC's attributes, while actions initiated towards the environment are passive and have a static difficulty related to them.
