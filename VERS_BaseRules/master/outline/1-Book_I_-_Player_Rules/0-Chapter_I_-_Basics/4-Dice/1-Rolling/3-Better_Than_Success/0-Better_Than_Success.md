Just determining if an action succeeded or failed is not always the most dramatic or interesting. This is where degrees of success come in. Whenever a dice roll results in a success, the roll is said to have degrees of success equal the amount the roll was under the competence target. Similarly, a roll has degrees of failure equal to the amount it went over the competence target. In other words a roll result of 8 with a CT of 13/- would give 5 degrees of success. These degrees of success are used to power stunts, which are discussed in more detail in the Gameplay chapter, but suffice to say they are extra effects of the roll which give them some edge. Similarly degrees of failure can power stunts against the character.
