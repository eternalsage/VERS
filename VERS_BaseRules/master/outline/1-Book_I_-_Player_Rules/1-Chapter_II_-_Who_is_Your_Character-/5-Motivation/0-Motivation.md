Very few people in the real world would ever do the things great heroes do by choice. The life of a hero is dirty, dangerous, and emotionally taxing on every level. To be willing to put oneself through that takes a very special type of person, driven by something extra. Sometimes this extra factor comes from within, such as a sense of justice or compassion, whereas sometimes they are external, like money and fame. That special something is called Motivation and are the ideals and goals that push a character forward.

Whenever a character finds themselves in a situation that challenges these motivations, they have an opportunity to dive deep into their character's psyche. Examples of such a situation would be a knight character having to confront the legally enforced suffering of innocents, such as slavery, or a samurai who is caught between his honor and his duty to his master who has ordered him to lie on his behalf. What will they do? How will they resolve it? What will be the consequences, emotionally, mentally, and physically? When a character is put into such a situation then they regain a point of spent momentum, so long as they stay in character and actively seek to solve the issue in game. This is ultimately up to the GM and the dramatic appropriateness of the tone and setting of the game.

In most games a character will only have one motivation. Some genres, however, like high fantasy, may work better with two (allowing for a paladin with Justice and Altruism, for example). This is ultimately up to the GM and the conventions of the genre.

The following chart shows some example motivations, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
