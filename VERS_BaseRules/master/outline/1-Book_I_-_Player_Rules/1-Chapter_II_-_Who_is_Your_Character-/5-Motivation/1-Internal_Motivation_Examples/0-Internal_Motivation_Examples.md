Internal motivation is a motivation that comes from within the character, usually a belief or a goal. The character seeks out or follows this motivation because they want to, even if they may feel that they do not have a choice: ***"I can't help it! I just*** **have** ***to find out if I am the greatest martial artist in the world."*** There is nothing forcing the character, though, but their own desires, including the expectations of others. If the character is not motivated by themselves but instead by what others see or think then it is an external motivation instead.

- **Altruism:** The belief that the good of others is more important than the good of the self. Includes ideas of charity and kindness, and often manifests as a desire to help others regardless of the hassle to the individual.

- **Curiosity:** The drive to explore, find, and discover. What is beyond the horizon? What is behind that door marked "Employees Only"? A character with this motivation just wants to know, regardless of if the knowledge itself is useful.

- **Faith:** The belief that there is a greater power and that it is worth upholding and striving to serve. Not always religious is the traditional sense, some types of faith can involve the proverbial Crown and Country or some other philosophy like stoicism that is short of a religion but which one can live their life by or in service of.

- **Fame:** The search for recognition, to become a household name, and by extension the riches and power that usually comes with it. Typically fame is achieved through artistic or athletic pursuits, although famous scientists, politicians, and many other occupations obviously exist.

- **Glory:** Similar in some ways to Fame, Glory has the added connotation of history, often in the notion of deeds being remembered for all time as opposed to being well known within her lifetime. Many times this is in relation to military pursuits but can also be in relation to other aspects of life. Glory fits more with a fantasy or historical games, but is not restricted to them.

- **Greed:** The simple desire for wealth above all else. Characters with this motivation will rarely do anything without compensation, and will often try to negotiate higher rates, sometimes in situations where it is distasteful. This is sometimes coupled with a similarly strong hording tendency, but other times the greedy character is also a big spender, always lavishing themselves in luxury.

- **Honor:** Honor has many different meanings across different cultures, but most versions agree to a concept of disciplined action, honesty, integrity, and upholding tradition. Honor is often held as the measure of a person in societies that value it, and its loss is often seen as a grave issue worthy of severe action to prevent, often including violence.

- **Justice:** Law above any other concerns. That would be the simplistic way to describe this motivation, but it is usually a little more involved. Characters tend to desire equality and safety and see the law as the best way to achieve this. This is not to say they will not break laws, but if they do they will be doing it knowingly and for a reason, like Rosa Parks did; a philosophy known as Civil Disobedience.

- **Nationalism:** Nationalism is a belief that one's country or nation is the greatest and that other nations are naturally inferior. Similar to Patriotism, the difference is that Nationalism focuses on negativity, denigrating and disrespecting those from other nations and cultures. This can sometimes lead to hatred and violence, but not always.

- **Patriotism:** Patriotism is a belief that one's country or nation is great and that they should do everything they can to protect and preserve it. Unlike Nationalism, Patriotism is more focused on what the individuals can do to make the country better and is more positive in its expression, wanting to share the greatness they see with others.

- **Responsibility:** ***"With great power comes great responsibility,"*** is the mantra of characters with this motivation, believing that if they have the ability to do something to change or make something better then they have a duty to do something. This does not mean that the think everything is their fault or they believe that they are the only ones who ***can*** solve the issue, just that they have to try.

- **Revenge:** The other side of Justice, Revenge is not fair, nor is it lawful usually. But it comes from the same emotional need to see wrongs righted and bad people punished. The biggest difference is that Revenge is a more purely emotional desire: ***"They must be made to pay for what they did to me!"*** as opposed to ***"They owe a debt to society for their actions."***

- **Validation:** This character not only seeks to accomplish something, but they seek it to prove to themselves that they can, either because they fear they can't or that they don't deserve it. The triggering events that make a character seek validation come from outside the character, but this is an internal motivation because they are making the choice to fight back in spite of those inhibitions.

- **Wanderlust:** Similar to Curiosity in some ways, Wanderlust describes a character who can't stay in one place for long. Maybe its because they never feel at home, or maybe its just that no one place is able to hold their attention. Regardless, they are the stereotypical vagabond passing through.
