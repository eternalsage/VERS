Unlike Internal Motivations, External Motivations are imposed on the character from outside. This could be from a person or persons, but as often as not it is the natural world, the environment, or the what

- **Duty:** This is a feeling of belonging to something greater and owing that person, place, or thing some course of action or behavior. Duty is, unlike Responsibility, something that the character is told they have, possibly even indoctrinated into, while Responsibility is more naturally occurring.

- **Family:** The idea that blood is thicker than water, that sharing a common genealogy, especially being raised in close proximity is a virtue, and forms unbreakable bonds. This can arise naturally as an internal motivation, but is more often imposed on the character growing up.

- **Famine:** The lack of food is a great motivator, forcing characters to change where and how they live, and even shake core beliefs and challenge cherished values. Even after the famine is over, these changed personality traits and beliefs will persist and can still drive major decisions in their lives.

- **Necessity:** A more generalized form of Famine, Necessity is the motivator of the survivor. Making hard choices and engaging in activities that they might have found questionable before they were faced with it, Necessity is, like most other external motivations, very dark and best fits character's in horror or other dark stories.

- **Obligation:** Similar to Duty, Obligation is often something that was at one time chosen, but is almost always considered negative now. Signed contracts, sworn oaths, and codes of conduct are all great examples of this.

- **Plague:** Like Famine, Plague is an external motivation that drags out both the best and worst in a character. This can either be a pandemic or a more personal brush with disease that changes or warps the character.

- **Religion:** Either for good or ill, religion has been the motivation for a large percentage of the actions of humanity over the millennia. Motivations from religion often focus on dogma, but can focus on the perversion of religion by religious leaders, or even struggling to live up to or by religious strictures.

- **Revenge:** Often confused with Justice, Revenge is more primal, retaliatory, and punishment driven form that invariably stems from an outside source of wrong. On the other hand, Justice can be personal, such as bringing a criminal to justice, or it can be a high ideal.

- **Rewards:** The search for wealth and status can be an internal motivation, see greed above, but when a reward, bounty, or other such boon is used to draw characters it is external. It may be a short lived motivation (until it is earned) or it could be recurring, in that the character is constantly seeking new rewards to challenge them.

- **War:** War is another societal level motivation, like Famine and Plague. Like those, it can be both a present tense motivator, involving what a character does to survive the war as well as a past tense look at how the war has changed them and their outlook.
