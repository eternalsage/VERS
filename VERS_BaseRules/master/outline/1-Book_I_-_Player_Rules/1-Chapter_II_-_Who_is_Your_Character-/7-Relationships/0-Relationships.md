When making characters it is important to define not just who they are and what they can do, but who do they know. Their social situation is very important to how they develop over time. That friend in high school that turned the character onto that obscure heavy metal band may very well have ignited a major part of their personality going forward, for instance.

When making a character, they must define relationships to at least two NPCs (either of their own creation, such as family members, etc, or those that already exist), and to at least half of the adventuring troop. Once the entire troop is done there will be an intricate web of social ties that bind these characters together into a cohesive, although perhaps dysfunctional whole. This will help to ease the characters into their stories, build into them a reason to trust each other (or at least to work together).

If a player wishes to define a familial or friendship connection with another player, both parties must agree. This would count as a connection for both characters. Characters can also share relationships to the same NPCs, each counting for both characters.

Characters who seek aide or advice from their relationships get a +2 bonus on any rolls that the NPC can assist them with. In most cases this benefit will be obvious, such as "My dad has been a car mechanic for 40 years, I bet he can help us figure out what this part comes from." Other such uses are less obvious and may need to be justified, such as "I have been really stressed out, so I hang out with my brother reading comic books all afternoon, can I get a bonus to Morale recovery?" These situations are dependent upon GM discretion and genre appropriateness.
