The final component to the traditional hero is a weakness, something that holds them back and that they must strive to overcome. This adversity is actually the defining characteristic for many heroes, the thing that people think of first when remembering them, such as their code against killing, a secret identity, or the tragedy that drove them to vengeance.

Like everything else so far, this too is true of RPG characters. A Flaw is a dramatic pathway for the GM to make a story or situation personal, as well as for a player to add some pathos to their character's story. Similarly to the character's Motivation, a Flaw is used in play to enhance a Momentum expenditure. This requires the character to be disadvantaged by the Flaw, to have trouble or conflict arise out of it and the player staying in character and dealing with those consequences.

A classic example of this would be Hercules. The character was actually born as Alcaeus, but later took the name Hercules, as it meant Glory of Hera. Hera hated Heracles as he was one of Zeus's many bastard children, and many of his adventures were had in overcoming the hardships that Hera put in his way which included many attempts on his life and even a confusion that caused him to kill his wife and children. Hercules would not have been a legendary figure had he not had the Flaw of being hated by the queen of the gods.

This also illustrates the fact that not all Flaws are internal or personal. They only need to be a running source of conflict for the character. They do not even need to be a "negative" thing, as most people would consider it. Something like a Code Against Killing, like many superheroes would have, is a Flaw, because any villain that is not more permanently dealt with could be back to harm innocents again.

Whenever a character finds themselves in a situation stemming from their Flaw (directly or indirectly) that challenges them, they have an opportunity to focus on their character and their struggles. What will happen? What are the stakes? What toll will it have on them and their allies? When a character is put into such a situation they regain a point of spent momentum, so long as they stay in character and actively seek to solve the issue in game. This is ultimately up to the GM and the dramatic appropriateness of the tone and setting of the game.

In most games a character will only have one flaw. Some genres, however, like a gritty street-level crime story, may work better with two. This is ultimately up to the GM and the conventions of the genre.

The following list shows some example flaws, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
