The Character Concept is the most basic seed of the character. It is a plain English description of that character that tells you what that character is like. Think of it like the blurb on the back of a book. The concept should tell you who they are, what the they do, how they behave, why they would risk their lives to go on adventures away from the safety of hearth and home.

For example, the character concept for Albert Battle-blooded, a character for a dark-ages inspired fantasy game would sound something like this: “The second son of a famous clan, Albert is both stout-hearted and level-headed. Living most of his life in his brother’s shadow, he has recently found himself the only thing that stands between his clan and the jaws of history. Now each night he says a prayer to the god of protection and stands in vigil over what’s left of his family, knowing he has little chance to see the break of day.”

From this we can gather several important things about the character: firstly, that while he was not the original heir, Albert still takes his duties to his clan seriously. He seems to have devoted his life to protecting them from something. Secondly, we also know he is calm in stressful situations and rarely lets his emotions run away with him. We also know that there is some danger that stalks his family in the night and that has possibly already claimed his elder brother. However, we can also see that Albert does not back down from the challenge but instead he takes his place as the only guardian that can protect his family and its legacy. We can also see that his is pious, looking to the gods for strength, and that instead of a god of glory, he seeks aid from a much humbler deity in the god of protection and duty. In just a few sentences Albert’s player paints a portrait of a character that tells us a lot, details that will help to build him as well as play him.
