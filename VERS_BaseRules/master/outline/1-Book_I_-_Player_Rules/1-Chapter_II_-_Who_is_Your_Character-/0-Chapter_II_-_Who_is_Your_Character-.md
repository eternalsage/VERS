The first step in creating a character is defining who that character is. Characters are not just collections of stats on a piece of paper. They are the representations of people, with all the mental and emotional parts required for that in addition to the physical. This first half of the character creation process is focused on those psychological elements that make a character tick. Don't worry though, its not as difficult as it seems.
