Hero is a term that is often used incorrectly, at least from the prospective of its Greek origins. A hero is not necessarily the good guy, but the person who drives the action forward. Hercules is a great example of this, in that he often does things that we, as modern readers, are horrified by. The players in an RPG perfectly reflect this definition. Whether they are the revolutionaries fighting an evil empire, the tyrants who enslave the population, or the bandits that profit from the chaos, they are the stars of the story who push the action forward and which the story at the table revolves around.

So, heroes are made of more than the average person, and the pinnacle of their excellence is their ability to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat; a tenacity to see their vision made real. This Momentum carries them past obstacles that would leave the average person battered and defeated. Momentum is a pool of points that a character can draw on in times of need to succeed where they may otherwise fail.

The primary use of Momentum allows the player to retry a roll and keep the best result. It can also be used to gain an additional action in combat, or gain a recovery action regardless of when the next one is due. Momentum can be enhanced when used in service of the character's Talent, or when focused on a character's Anchor. When enhanced, spent Momentum points will grant automatic success on a roll with 3 degrees of success, move the character to the front of the combat order (starting the next Turn), or remove the highest level condition of one type.

Characters have a number of Momentum points equal to twice their Power Level. Momentum can only be regained by acting in accordance with a character's Motivations and Flaws. One point is regained each time a character is put into a difficult spot because the character is roleplaying these weaknesses. Only one point of momentum can be spent per character per turn, and that point only applies to the single roll it was invoked for.
