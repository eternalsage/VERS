Each character has one thing that they are better at than anyone else. This is the thing they most pride themselves on. They could be the strongest, or toughest, or bravest, the best swimmer, or the chess master. Just about anything could his or her talent, the only limit is that it must be unique among the players.

Talents are like a statement of what the character feels most confident with, or what they understand as their strength. This does not have to actually correspond to their best Attributes or Skills, but instead their perceptions of themselves. Depending on the character's background and experiences they may be completely wrong about their talents, and thats ok. What matters is breathing life into the character, not maximizing their effectiveness. To this end a character can change their talent as the game progresses and they learn more about themselves. This change cannot be made during a game session, but must be between episodes.

When facing a challenge on which the player is spending a point of momentum, the player can choose to invoke their talent to enhance their momentum's effect. This must be explained by the player, such as: *"As I force myself to calm down, I realize that the bomb's timer is actually just another type of electronics. I think I can defuse it. I've been repairing and building electronic devices since I was a kid!"* This explanation is subject to GM discretion and what is dramatically appropriate for the game's tone and setting.

Below is a small list of example Talents.
