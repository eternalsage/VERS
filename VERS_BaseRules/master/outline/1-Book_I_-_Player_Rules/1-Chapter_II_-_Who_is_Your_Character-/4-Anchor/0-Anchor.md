Much like every great hero has a talent that sets them apart from other, every hero also has something that keeps them grounded and ties them to the world and society in some way. Maybe that is a family member, a friend, a memento from a special trip, or even just that clearing in the woods that the character always loved to play in as a kid. This is an anchor, and it is the reminder of what is at stake and why the character pushes forward.

To be clear, Anchors are a type of a motivating force, but are distinct from Motivations. Anchors are like the picture of his wife that the fighter pilot has taped to the wall of his plane's cockpit. They are a reminder of what a character stands to lose. Anchors are more personal and usually hinge around a person, place, or thing, whereas Motivations, in the VERS sense, are more idealogical.

When facing a challenge in which the player is spending a point of momentum, the player can invoke their character's anchor to enhance their momentum's effect. This must be explained by the player, such as: *"He touches his dead wife's ring that hangs on a chain around his neck and knows that he **has** to succeed!"* This explanation is ultimately subject to GM discretion and the dramatic appropriateness of the action.

Below is a small list of example anchors.
