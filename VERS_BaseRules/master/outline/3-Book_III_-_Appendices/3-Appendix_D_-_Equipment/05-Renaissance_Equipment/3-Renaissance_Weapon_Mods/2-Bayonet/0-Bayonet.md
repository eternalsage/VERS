A small knife that could be attached to the end of a musket barrel to enable a musket to still be used in defense even when empty or when caught in close quarters. Essentially turns the musket into a makeshift spear, although it is not quite as effective as a spear due to the exact configuration (off-center design means less stabbing force). The bayonet could also be used as a knife when not attached. (+1 Damage: 3; -3 Size: 3; +1 Reach (Only when attached): 1) 7 CP.
