Towards the end of the renaissance/early modern period came the design of the sabre. Based in part of blades from the middle east such as the talwar and the falchion, the sabre was a thin, edged blade with a curving shape. Like the rapier it tended to be used for quick attacks and often had a handguard. Because of the curved blade, the sabre was particularly effective as a cavalry weapon.
