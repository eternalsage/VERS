The key technology of this time frame was gunpowder. It had existed for centuries, even in the west, but it wasnâ€™t until now that it was reliable enough to count on in the thick of battle. Even then firearms were still inaccurate, took an extremely long time to load, and could explode in the right conditions. Humid or rainy conditions also ruined their ability to fire. Quick training times and considerable stopping power saw them gradually grow in importance.
