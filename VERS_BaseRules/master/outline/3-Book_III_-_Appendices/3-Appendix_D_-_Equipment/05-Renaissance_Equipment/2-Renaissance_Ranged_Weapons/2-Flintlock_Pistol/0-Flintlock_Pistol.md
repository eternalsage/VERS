The flintlock pistol was a single fire, muzzle loading weapon designed for close quarters fights (it was highly inaccurate more than 20 meters away) and was often carried in multiples, to facilitate multiple quick firings. Typically a person would fire his pistol and then close for the kill with his rapier. The flintlock, like all muzzle loading firearms, takes 4 turns to reload.
