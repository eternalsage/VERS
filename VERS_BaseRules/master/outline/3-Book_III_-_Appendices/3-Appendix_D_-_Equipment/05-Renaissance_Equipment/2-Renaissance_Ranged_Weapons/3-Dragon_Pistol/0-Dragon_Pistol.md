Much like the flintlock, the dragon was a single fire, one handed ranged weapon, but instead of a single ball, dragons were loaded with shot, making them the ancestor to modern shotguns. Dragons pack a bit more punch than the standard flintlock and their spread (much greater than a modern shotgun) meant that even being highly inaccurate they were likely to strike something.
