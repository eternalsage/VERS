Similar in many ways, brigandine was a hybrid of plate and laminar armor, consisting of multiple large plates that overlapped but that could move freely, thus being more flexible and cheaper to create and maintain. Many times these were sewn into vests and the like, being less visible than other types of armor, and reflecting the gradual move away from armor in general. (+5 Protection: 15) 15 CP.
