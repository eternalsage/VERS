Quite possibly the most technologically advanced weapon in the world, a tech-katana is a lightweight combination of super durable carbon nanotube technology, exotic plastics designed for aerospace use, and traditional alloys that never needs sharpening, is capable of cutting through any mundane material, and can withstand forces that would break a diamond. They are also capable of being modded to deliver intense electrical current, glow in several different colors bright enough to act as a light source, and be connected to a comm to upload physics data in real time and do other interesting tricks.
