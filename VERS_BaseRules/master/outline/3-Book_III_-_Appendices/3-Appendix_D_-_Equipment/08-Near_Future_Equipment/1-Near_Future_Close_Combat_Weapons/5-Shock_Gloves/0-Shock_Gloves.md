Designed more for concealability than effectiveness, these lightweight gloves contain contact points which, when activated, send a painful electric jolt into the opponent, possibly knocking them unconscious. These gloves recharge themselves through the movement of the character, never needing to be recharged. (+1 Afflict (Unconscious): 3; -5 Size: 5, -1 Mass: 1) 9 CP.
