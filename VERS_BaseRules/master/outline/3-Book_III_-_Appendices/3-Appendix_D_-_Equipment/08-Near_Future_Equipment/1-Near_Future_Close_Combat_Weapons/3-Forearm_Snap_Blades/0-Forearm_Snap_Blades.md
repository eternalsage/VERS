Favored by assassins everywhere, these unassuming weapons are sheathed along the forearm. With a button press or pre-programmed gesture the blades spring into place, complete with a handle to improve leverage and applicable force. The blades themselves are about 30 cm long and while contracted give an additional +1 to Protection when in close combat. (+2 Damage: 6; +3 Hardness: 6, -4 Size: 4) 16 CP.
