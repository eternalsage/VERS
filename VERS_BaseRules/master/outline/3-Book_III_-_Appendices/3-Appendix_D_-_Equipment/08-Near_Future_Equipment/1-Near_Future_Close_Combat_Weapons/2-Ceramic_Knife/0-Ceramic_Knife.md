A short, thin blade made out of exotic ceramics. Very tough, non-conductive, undetectable by most weapons scanners, and extremely good at keeping an edge, these knives are on the cutting edge of materials technology (pun intended). Their one drawback is that, while resilient to striking head-on or along the blade, they do not handle twisting or shearing forces well, tending to break instead of bend. (+2 Damage: 4; -3 Size: 3; Aerodynamic: 3, 4 Hardness: -1) 9 CP.
