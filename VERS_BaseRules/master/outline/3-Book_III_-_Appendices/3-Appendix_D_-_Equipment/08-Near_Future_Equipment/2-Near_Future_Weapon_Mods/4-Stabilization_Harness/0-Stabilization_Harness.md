The stabilization harness is essentially a mechanized assist to allow normal humans to use large, heavy weapons more effectively, such as heavy machine guns and the like. It consists of a pair of articulated hydraulic arms that help hold the mass as well as stabilize the recoil. One arm attaches to the belt of the device, the other attaches over the shoulder (adjustable for lefties) to the backpack power device that powers both the harness and the heavy weapon in question (if required).
