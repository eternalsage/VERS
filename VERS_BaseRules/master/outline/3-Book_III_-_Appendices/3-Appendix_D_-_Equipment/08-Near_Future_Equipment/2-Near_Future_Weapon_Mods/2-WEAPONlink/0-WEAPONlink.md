The Wireless Environment Aware Projectile Operation Network link (WEAPONlink for short) is a modification that allows information from a weapon to be passed to a computer, analyzed, and then passed to the user of the weapon for up to the second details about the weaponâ€™s performance, such as heat build-up, remaining ammo, fire modes, wear and tear on moving parts and more. This also allows a user to change fire modes, eject clips, turn safeties on or off and even fire the weapon without actually touching it.
