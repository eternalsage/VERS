What looks on the surface like a well tailored suit is, in fact, a high tech armor suit that utilizes small, discreet pockets that hide non-newtonian fluid armor over all the most sensitive parts of the body. This piecemeal design is not going to keep you from harm, but it might keep you from a slab in the morgue. (+4 Protection: 12, -3 Perception penalty to discern as armor: 6) 18 CP.
