The infiltration suit is a thin meshe not dissimilar from ancient chainmail except that itâ€™s made of carbon nano-tubes weaved together to give amazing durability in such a light, flexible package. In addition to its protective nature, this armor is capable of producing an energy field that bends the ambient light around the user, granting them a bonus to Stealth.
