The following equipment is roughly arranged from most ancient to futuristic. Equipment like bows and swords will not be repeated as all equipment in this document are being created with all time frames in mind. What this means is that it would be possible to take a weapon from the ancient list and use it in a space opera setting, perhaps as a museum piece or even as belonging to a primitive species on a backwater planet. As always, this list is not intended to be definitive, and represents examples of how to build equipment for your game and setting.
