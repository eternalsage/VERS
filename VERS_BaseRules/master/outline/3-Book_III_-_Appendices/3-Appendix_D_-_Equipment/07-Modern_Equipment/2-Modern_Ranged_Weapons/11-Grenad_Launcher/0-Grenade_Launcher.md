Despite the name, the grenade launcher does not, in fact, launch what the average person thinks of as a grenade. Instead of a hand grenade the launcher lobs explosive charges at a low velocity on a short ballistic arc. These charges are typically loaded via a revolver style mechanism although some models use a magazine action instead.
