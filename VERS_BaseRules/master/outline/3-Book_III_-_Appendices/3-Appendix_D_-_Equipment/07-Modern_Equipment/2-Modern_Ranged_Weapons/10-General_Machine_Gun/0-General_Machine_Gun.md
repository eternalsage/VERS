Unlike the light machine gun, the medium and heavy machine guns are designed to be stationary, either mounted to a vehicle or from a bi-pod or tripod on the ground. The recoil and weight makes it nearly impossible to fire by hand without assistance, however it is possible with a Strength of 3 or greater (with GM permission). Heavy machine guns cannot be fired in this way period. (7 Damage: 21; -1 Size: 1; Automatic: 3; +3 Mass: -3; Required Hands: -2; Limited Uses: -1; -4 Ranged Attack: -8; Loud: -2) 9 CP.
