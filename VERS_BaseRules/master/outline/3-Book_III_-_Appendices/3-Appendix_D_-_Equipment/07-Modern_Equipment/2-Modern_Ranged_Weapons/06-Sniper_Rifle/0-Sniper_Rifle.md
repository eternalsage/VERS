With an elongated barrel, extremely high caliber, high energy ammo, and a mass of 7 kg (15 lbs), the sniper rifle is the ultimate in long range death dealing, capable of making a kill at ranges in excess of a kilometer. This comes with a price however, with the weapon being bulky enough to make shooting on the move impractical, firing from a bipod or the like is a practical necessity.
