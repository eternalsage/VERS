Designed primarily as an easily portable suppression weapon, the original light machine guns happened to be light enough that a soldier could fire the weapon while standing and moving, allowing him more mobility than heavier weapons. This firing from the hip was highly inaccurate, but was more designed to keep enemies in cover or from advancing than it was for actually stopping them. If the weapon is properly deployed on a bipod or tripod, ignore the Ranged Attack penalty.
