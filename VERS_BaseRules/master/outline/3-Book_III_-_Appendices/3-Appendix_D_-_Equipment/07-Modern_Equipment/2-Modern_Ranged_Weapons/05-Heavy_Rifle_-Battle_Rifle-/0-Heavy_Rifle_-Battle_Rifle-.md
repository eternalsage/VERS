The other side of the coin from the automatic rifle, the battle rifle operates best in situations where long ranges and short controlled bursts are required, sacrificing the number of rounds sent down range for higher stopping power and improved distance. While not quite sniper ranged, a battle rifle is the go to weapon for a marksman on the go.
