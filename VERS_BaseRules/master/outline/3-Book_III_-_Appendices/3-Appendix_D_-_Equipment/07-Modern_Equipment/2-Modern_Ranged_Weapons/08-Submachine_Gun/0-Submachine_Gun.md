The submachine gun was the go to weapon of the early 20th century, being light, small, and capable of laying down large amounts of ammo with ease. Based off light pistol ammo, the weapon was not known for stopping power or accuracy (due to the recoil with such a light frame) and the weapon type soon fell into disuse as automatic rifles and battle rifles became more common. They are still a valuable tool in the right situations and spec ops teams like the US Navy SEALS still deploy a large number of these types of weapons.
