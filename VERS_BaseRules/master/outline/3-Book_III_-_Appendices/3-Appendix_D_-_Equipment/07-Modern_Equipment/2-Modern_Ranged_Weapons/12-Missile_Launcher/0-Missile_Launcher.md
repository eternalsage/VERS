The largest, most destructive hand-held weapon in existence, the missile launcher (aka rocket propelled grenade launcher) was created as an effective anti-tank and sometimes anti-air weapon. This role is fulfilled, as well as making it effective against enemy emplacements, highly defensible buildings, and pretty much anywhere and anything else that the soldier needs to go away in a hurry.
