Also known as “SWAT gear” this is a heavier version of the previous, complete with strategic plates covering vital areas and often using state of the art armor technology. Besides some top secret government project stuff, this is the top of the line in death prevention in the modern world, capable of soaking up even a sniper shot with fair survivability.
