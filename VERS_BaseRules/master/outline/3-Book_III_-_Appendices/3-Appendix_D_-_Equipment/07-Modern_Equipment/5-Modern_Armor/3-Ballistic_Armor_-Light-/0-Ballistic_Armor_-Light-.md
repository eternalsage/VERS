More advanced than simple armored vests, these protective suits are often colloquially known as “riot gear” as they are often deployed by police in riot situations. Made of multiple layers of kevlar plates, these suits are both lightweight and flexible while providing high quality protection capable of stopping a rifle round. (+6 Protection: 18) 18 CP.
