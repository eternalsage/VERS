A large yet lightweight shield made of steel, plexiglass, and advanced plastics, the riot shield is the go to weapon when things get rowdy. The see-through design makes it possible to defend from more attacks while remaining covered, and the large size makes it easy to take up formation and keep large groups at bay safely.
