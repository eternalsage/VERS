Essentially personalized chemical warfare, pepper spray is a non-lethal aerosol delivery system that fills the air (or the assailantâ€™s face) with acrid liquid which burns to inhale and temporarily blinds if it gets in the eyes. Because of the delivery system, pepper spray is considered a close range attack. (3 Major Affliction (Blindness): 9) 9 CP.
