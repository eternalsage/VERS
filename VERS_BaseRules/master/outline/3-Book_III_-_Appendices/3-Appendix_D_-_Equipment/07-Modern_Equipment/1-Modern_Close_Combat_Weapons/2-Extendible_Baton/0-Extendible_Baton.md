Designed for law enforcement agents, this weapon resembles a 20 cm cylinder with a small switch on the side. When activated a spring mechanism extends the collapsible baton to its full 60 cm length and locks it into place at which point it is a formidable non-lethal weapon. Then with a twist the entire thing collapses back again. Being both easily concealable and highly effective, it has become standard equipment to security forces around the globe.
