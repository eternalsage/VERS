Two different technologies that ultimately do the same job, which is to allow for the rapid acquisition of targets. These types of sights do not make it easier to hit distant targets (in fact, because light travels in straight lines while bullets do not, they may make long distance firing less accurate) they do help to quickly establish whether the target is in the line of fire. This can make the difference between life and death in a firefight, while they are less useful in hunting where longer distances and slower reflex speeds are the norm. These can be combined with night vision with no ill effects. (+1 ranged attack: 2) 2 CP.
