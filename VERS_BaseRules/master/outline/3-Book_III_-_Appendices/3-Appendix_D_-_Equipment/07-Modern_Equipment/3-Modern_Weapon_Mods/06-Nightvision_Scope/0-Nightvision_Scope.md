Unlike other types of scope and sighting devices, the nightvision scope simply allows the user to see in the dark. Not as useful as nightvision goggles in that the effect is only visible in the eye looking down the sight and thus only seen when using the sight, while goggles are always on, a nightvision scope has the benefit of being much less cumbersome and able to be quickly transitioned away from in case of bright flashes and the like.
