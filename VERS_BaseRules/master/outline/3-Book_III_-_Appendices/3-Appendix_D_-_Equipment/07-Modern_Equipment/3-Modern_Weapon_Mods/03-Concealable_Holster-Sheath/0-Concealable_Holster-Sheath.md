A concealable holster/sheath is designed to be out of sight, mostly by staying very close to the body and utilizing fabrics and straps that minimize the additional thickness. Even the best options in concealment can only hide small weapons, and even then only from a distance. A pat down or other method is practically guaranteed to find the hidden weapon. (-1 Penalty to Perception while holstered, Only for weapons sized -3 or smaller) 1 CP.
