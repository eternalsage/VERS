Much like the earlier telescopic sights, these magnify distant targets making it easier to make accurate long distance shots. The difference is that the multi-scope can be set to several different magnification levels making it useful at many different ranges. These are not compatible with night vision enhancements or other sight types. (Telescopic 4 (Multiple Effects): 27) 27 CP.
