Ballistic Reinforcement
The ballistic reinforcement is essentially a plate that straps across the chest of other armor (or by itself more rarely) that acts as an additional layer of protection specifically designed to stop bullets. Made of overlapping ceramic discs not dissimilar for scalemail, this plate is destroyed after taking a couple of shots, however the extra protection is worth it.
