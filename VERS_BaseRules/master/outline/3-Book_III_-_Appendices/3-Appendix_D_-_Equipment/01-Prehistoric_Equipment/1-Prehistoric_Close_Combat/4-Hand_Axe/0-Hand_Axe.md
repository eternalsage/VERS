Basically a hatchet or something similar, the first hand axe was a simple flat sharpened stone tied to the end of a stick. This was soon replaced by copper, and then bronze, and eventually steel. But regardless of the composition, the hand axe was a tool that happened to also be pretty good at killing your neighbor. (+2 Damage: 6; -3 Size: 3; Aerodynamic: 3) 12 CP.
