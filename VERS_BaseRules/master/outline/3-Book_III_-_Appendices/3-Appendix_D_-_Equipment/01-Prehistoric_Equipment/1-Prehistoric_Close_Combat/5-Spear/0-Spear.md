A long pole with a sharpened point. In the beginning this point was shaped stone, although as humanityâ€™s technology has improved so has the spear tip. Even in the modern day however, this is still the weapon that our ancestors used to take down mastodons. (+3 Damage: 9; -1 Size: 1; +1 Reach: 2; Set: 2; 1.5 Hands: -1) 13 CP.
