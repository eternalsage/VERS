Not much more than a scrap of leather tied to a piece of rope, the sling is probably the most primitive of all ranged weapons, essentially just being a better way to throw a stone. To use the sling the rock or other projectile is loaded into the leather strap then itâ€™s spun at a high rate of speed and then released at the right moment to use the angular momentum to hurl the stone much farther than would otherwise be possible.  (+2 Strength (only to throw stones): 4; -5 Size: 5) 9 CP.
