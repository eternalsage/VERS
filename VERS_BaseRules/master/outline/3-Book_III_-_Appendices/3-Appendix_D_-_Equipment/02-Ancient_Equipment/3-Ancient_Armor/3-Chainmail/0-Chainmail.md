Chainmail is one of the longest used armor techniques, reportedly created by the Celts around the early days of Rome, chain was still used for protection in some capacity all the way until the renaissance period, and is still used today to make suits to protect from shark attack. Because of the way it hangs on the character it can be very tiring to wear for long. If using chain to reinforce other armor (under it, typically) then it adds a +2 Protection instead. (+3 Protection: 9; +2 Mass: -2) 7 CP.
