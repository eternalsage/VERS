Blades were not effective fighting tools until the advent of smelting in the late neolithic. Then it became feasible to craft a metal blade that could hold an edge and reasonably penetrate the skin without breaking. While the designs may differ, there is little difference between the different types of daggers. (+1 Damage: 3; -3 Size: 3; Aerodynamic: 3; -1 Reach: -2) 7 CP.
