The prefered weapon of the nobility, especially in Egypt and Sumeria, the mace was a mark of office. This symbolic use eventually evolved into the idea of the royal scepter that is still in existence around the world. The light mace would resemble a short wooden handle (roughly 30 to 40 cm in length) topped with a heavy stone or metal ball. Those used by the nobility were often intricately decorated and warriors took great pride in these weapons. (+2 Damage: 6; -3 Size: 3; Dull: -3) 6 CP.
