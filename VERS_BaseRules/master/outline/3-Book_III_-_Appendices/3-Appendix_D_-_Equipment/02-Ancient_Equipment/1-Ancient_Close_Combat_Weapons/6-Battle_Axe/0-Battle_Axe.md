A powerful weapon, primarily used by the Vikings, a battle axe was the perfect weapon for splintering defenses with its high mass and curved cutting surface. Not only that, but itâ€™s crescent shape was also useful for disrupting shield walls, hooking a shield edge and pulling it out of position. In addition, the relatively small amount of lower quality steel used in their construction meant that they were cheap and thus easily acquired.
