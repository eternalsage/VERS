Much like the light mace, the heavy mace was as much ceremonial as it was effective. With a longer handle (40 to 60 cm) and a larger heavier head, the heavy mace was extremely effective at crushing the skulls of opponents although this extra mass also required a bit more strength to wield appropriately.
