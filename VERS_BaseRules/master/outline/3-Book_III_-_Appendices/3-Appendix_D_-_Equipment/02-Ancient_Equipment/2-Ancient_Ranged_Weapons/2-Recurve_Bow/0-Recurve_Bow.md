The need to penetrate newer and stronger armors led to numerous changes to bow design, but the two biggest were the introduction of composite construction (multiple materials) and the idea of recurve. Recurve bows have arms that curve away from the shooter when unstrung. This allows for a greater storage of kinetic energy resulting in more force and greater distance.
