The sword cane (also called a sword-stick) is a disguised blade that masquerades as a walking cane, umbrella, or the like. This configuration enabled upper-class men and women to maintain a level of self defense while still be acceptable in regular company. Because of the dimensions required the cane sword was thin and of a moderate length, not designed for long term or regular use especially not against armor and the like.
