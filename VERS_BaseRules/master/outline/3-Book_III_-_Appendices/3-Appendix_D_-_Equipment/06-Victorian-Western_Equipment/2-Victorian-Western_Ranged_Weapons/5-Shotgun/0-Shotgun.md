As the musket became the rifle, so too did the musketoon become the shotgun. Early shotguns were breechloading while later examples made use of a pump action to eject spent shells. In many ways the shotgun has been unchanged since it first appeared on the market over 150 years ago. (8 Damage: 24; -2 Size: 2; +1 Mass: -1; 2 Hands: -2; Limited Uses: -2; Loud: -2) 19 CP.
