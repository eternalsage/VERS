One of the first attempts at making a shotgun that could be fired repeatedly, the double barreled shotgun is still used in the modern era because it is reliable, simple, and more than sufficient for hunting or home defense. An added bonus for the design was the ability to pull the trigger on both barrels simultaneously, greatly increasing the damage potential of the weapon. Because of the breech loading design and the low capacity the shotgun requires a turn to reload when empty.
