Also referred to as a sporting rifle or a hunting rifle, this weapon is used in modern times for target shooting, hunting game, and home defense, but it was originally a military weapon. Early examples are bolt action and require manually ejecting a spent casing, while later versions take advantage of a lever to perform the action.
