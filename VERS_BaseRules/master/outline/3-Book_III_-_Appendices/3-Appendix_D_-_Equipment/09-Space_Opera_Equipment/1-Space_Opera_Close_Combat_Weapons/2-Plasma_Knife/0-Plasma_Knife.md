By harnessing the extreme energies involved in the “4th phase of matter” called plasma within a strong, shaped electromagnetic field, a plasma knife is capable of cutting through nearly anything with ease. Using different gases to create the blade gives it a different color, but has little to no effect on the actual usefulness of said blade. When turned off, the weapon is a small unassuming rod approximately 20 cm in length. (9 Damage (Piercing): 36, -4 Size: 4; Must be recharged after 8 hours of use (1 week on average): -1) 40 CP.
