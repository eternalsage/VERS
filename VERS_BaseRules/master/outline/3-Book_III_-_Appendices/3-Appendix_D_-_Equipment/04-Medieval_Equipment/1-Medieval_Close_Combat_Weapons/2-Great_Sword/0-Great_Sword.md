An enormous blade, often over a meter in length, the great sword was created primarily for dealing with mounted foes, being long enough to strike them while mounted but also more capable for use against troops on the ground than a spear which was primarily useful in a formation. Prohibitively expensive and of dubious advantage, great swords were fairly rare on the historical battlefield. (+4 Damage: 12; +1 Reach: 2; +3 Mass: -3; Required Hands: -2) 9 CP.
