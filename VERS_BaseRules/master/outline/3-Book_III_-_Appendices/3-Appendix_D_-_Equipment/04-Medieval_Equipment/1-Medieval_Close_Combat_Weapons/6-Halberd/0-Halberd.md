In many ways the ultimate polearm, the halberd combines the qualities of a spear, and axe, and a war hammer. With a large spear head on the top, a deadly axe blade to the front, and a savage armor piercing spike to the rear, all atop a long wooden handle (around 2 meters in length), the halberd is essentially capable of dealing with nearly any situation. This versatility comes at a price, however, of being less good than any one of the weapons it is comprised of. (+4 Damage (Piercing): 16; Set: 2; +1 Reach: 2; Required Hands: -2; +3 Mass: -3) 15 CP.
