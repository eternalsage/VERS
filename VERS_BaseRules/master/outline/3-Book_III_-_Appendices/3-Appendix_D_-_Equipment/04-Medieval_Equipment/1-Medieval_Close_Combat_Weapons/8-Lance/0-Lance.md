The iconic weapon of the mounted knight, the lance is a highly specialized pole-arm only useful from horseback. It was intended for a single use (they often splintered from the force of the impact) and nearly useless on foot because of the balance. Nonetheless, a lance strike to a standing opponent was typically enough to kill even the most heavily armored foe. When figuring the base EV of the lance, add in both the movement of the horse and its size.
