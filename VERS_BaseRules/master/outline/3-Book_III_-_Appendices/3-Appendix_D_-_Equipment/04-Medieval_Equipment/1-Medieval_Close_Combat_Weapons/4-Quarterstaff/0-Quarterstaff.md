Primarily a weapon of the peasant class, the quarterstaff is basically just a long stick, although staves meant for actually fighting were often equipped with iron tips and maybe even reinforced with stips of iron along the length. The leverage of the length combined with the surprising speed of the staff made it much more formidable than might otherwise be believed. (+3 Damage: 9; Required Hands: -2) 7 CP.
