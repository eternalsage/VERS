The falchion and other blades like it were of middle eastern design, and rarely used in Europe at the time. They were, however, the primary weapon of the numerous Muslim countries in the middle east during this time (and slightly earlier into the dark age crusades) and were primarily designed for attacking from horseback, thus the long, curved blade. These would eventually evolve into the sabres of the late renaissance period. (+2 Damage (+3 when mounted): 6; -1 Size: 1; +1 Mass: -1) 6 CP.
