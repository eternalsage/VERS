Unlike the typical image the term warhammer tends to conjure in peopleâ€™s minds of a weapon resembling a sledgehammer, and actual warhammer tended to be much smaller in the head, looking more like a normal hammer on a much longer (30 to 40 cm) shaft. The common misconception that it was the huge mass of the hammer belies the true effectiveness with is the mass being spread over a very small area greatly increasing the force produced. War hammers often had one blunt side useful against heavy armor and one spiked side which could be used to hook shields or entangle reigns.
