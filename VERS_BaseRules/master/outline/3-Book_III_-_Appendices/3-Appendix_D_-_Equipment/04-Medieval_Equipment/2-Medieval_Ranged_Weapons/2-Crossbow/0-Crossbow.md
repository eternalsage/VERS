There is a saying in England from medieval times stating that “To train a bowman it is necessary to start by training his grandfather.” While somewhat hyperbolic, it is true that archery skills take years to build to the point they are useful on the battlefield. Enter the crossbow, the world’s first point and shoot ranged weapon (originally designed in ancient times, but due to material and mechanical deficiencies were largely toys). While slower and less accurate than bowmen, a crossbow fired with more force, penetrating even heavy armor, and a levy took weeks to train instead of years, making up in quantity what it lacked in quality.
