The time between the end of the Viking era and the advent of gunpowder and cannons. Primarily known for its increasing nationalism and the growth of the fundamentals of our modern concepts of governance, this time frame is also the period of Robin Hood and King Arthur (even though historically speaking, if he existed it was probably during the early Dark Ages instead).
