Like the buckler, advances in military technology had finally led to wide ranging changes in tactics. The increasing use of mounted combat mean that shield technology also needed to change, and thus the heater was born. With a rounded top and an elongated bottom, this asymmetric shield design maximized cover for attacks from below, as could be expected while mounted. (+3 Physical Defense: 6) 6 CP.
