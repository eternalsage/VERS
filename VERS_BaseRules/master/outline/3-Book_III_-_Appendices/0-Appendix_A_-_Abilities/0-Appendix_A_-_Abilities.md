The following abilities are not intended to be the summation of all possible abilities, but merely some (loose) genre appropriate abilities to give guidance, inspiration, and to ultimately serve as a quick solution when you need something in a hurry. For this reason these are very generic, so to fit in your game you may need to do some adaptation.
