Issue a command that is unignorable. The target will not voluntarily end his or her life nor harm themselves but will instead interpret orders that would obviously lead to harm in a less harmful way (i.e. Commanding him to the edge of a cliff and telling him to jump, he will instead jump up and down in place instead of over the top).
