Only learnable by those with fomorian/jotun blood, elemental magic allows the user control over one of the four elements (fire, water, earth, and storm) based on the element of their giant ancestor. Elemental magicâ€™s connection with the fomorians means that open use of such power can cause mistrust, fear, or even open hostility from onlookers.
