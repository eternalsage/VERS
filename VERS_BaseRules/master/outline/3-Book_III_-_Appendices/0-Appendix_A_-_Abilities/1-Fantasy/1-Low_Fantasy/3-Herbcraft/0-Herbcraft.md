Learnable by anyone, Herbcraft helps repair wounds, push the body beyond its normal limits, and cure disease. Direct healing (magically closing wounds in seconds and the like) and resurrection are not even possible by the gods of this world, and so are also out of the reach of even the greatest druid. All herbcraft abilities require an hour to prepare and access to a ready supply of herbs. Dried specimens give a -2 penalty to the roll.
