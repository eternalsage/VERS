Shapechanging, unlike the other magical skills available, is not an ability theme but a single ability which enables the user to change his or her shape into that of her ysbryd/fylgja (and only this shape). This is purchased as the Transform ability, as outlined below, while the details of the alternate form is given in the ysbryd/fylgja write ups.
Transform (Character into Ysbryd/Fylgja): Extreme (2x targetâ€™s defense), Revert Condition: Reuse of this ability, Self Only (-1). CP per Rank: 4
