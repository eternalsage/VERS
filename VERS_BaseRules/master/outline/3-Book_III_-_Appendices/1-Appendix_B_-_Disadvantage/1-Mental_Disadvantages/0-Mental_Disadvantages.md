Mental disadvantages are typically psychological and usually represent urges, fears, or other instabilities that a character has to deal with. Except for the case of mental handicaps, a character wishing to abstain from indulging in a mental disadvantage must make a Mental Defence roll with a -2 penalty for a minor disadvantage or a -4 for a major disadvantage. Getting rid of mental disadvantages nearly always involves mental health professionals (or the closest thing in the setting, such as a religious figure in a fantasy setting) and a lot of personal effort. Even then most mental problems can only be downgraded and dealt with and not actually removed. Without GM permission a mental disadvantage can only be reduced by one step (a major reduced to a minor, or a minor actually removed) and no more.

Mental disadvantages have to do with the character’s mind or mental state. Maybe it doesn’t work properly, or maybe they have certain strong convictions that make it hard for them to get by in the everyday world.
