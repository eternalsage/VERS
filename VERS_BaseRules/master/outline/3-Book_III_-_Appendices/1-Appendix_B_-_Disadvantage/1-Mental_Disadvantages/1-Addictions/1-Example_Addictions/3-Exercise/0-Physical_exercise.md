It is true that exercise is good for you, generally speaking. However, constantly working out, be it long cardio sessions or excessive weight training may not just be sub-optimal but actually detrimental to development. Not only that, but the dopamine released (“runner’s high”) can be enough for some to become addicted to the feeling, getting upset when they can’t go for a jog or getting moody when prevented from getting to the gym for a few weeks. Often this has roots in other mental disadvantages as well, such as vanity, or perhaps a feeling of inadequacy.
