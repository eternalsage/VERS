Hunted characters are always in the run, sought for their crimes or possibly for being witness to another’s crimes, or for any number of other reasons. Regardless of the hunters motivations, a hunted character does not need to know the reasons, or even that hunters are after them. Hunted interactions don’t have to actually involve combat or major story developments, instead often being as simple as feeling the need to leave town before getting fully resupplied, paranoia when near agents of the hunters (or characters that might be agents of the hunters), or avoiding social interactions to not involve others in their problems. The important thing is that the character be inconvenienced and possible left vulnerable on occasion because of the disadvantage.
