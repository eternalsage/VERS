Similar to distinctive features, a character with distinctive mannerisms acts in a distinctive or memorable way. This could be a rare accent, a particularly large vocabulary, or a habit of washing their hands a lot. Regardless of the source, this little quirk marks the character in npc’s minds just as surely as them have a strange eye color or facial tattoos. How distinctive a character’s mannerisms are varies from society to society (and even among classes within said society), and one culture may revere things that stand out as a negative in another.
