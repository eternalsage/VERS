Social disadvantages primarily stem from problems the character has when interacting with others, whether by the characters own shortcomings or just by existing in an intolerant environment. Most social disadvantages are dependent on other characters noticing them, which is typically a Perception roll with a bonus based on whether the disadvantage is minor (+2) or major (+4). Because of this, the player may attempt a Deception roll to hide his disadvantage, depending on the disadvantage in question and the situation at hand. Disadvantages like Responsibility, Secret, and some forms of Class require knowledge on the part of the NPC to come into play, and are thus not subject to a simple Perception roll.
