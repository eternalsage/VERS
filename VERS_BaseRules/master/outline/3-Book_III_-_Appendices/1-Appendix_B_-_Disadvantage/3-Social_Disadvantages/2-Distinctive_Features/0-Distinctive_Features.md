Sometimes character have looks that set them apart from the crowd, such as a recognizable tattoo on their arm, a tall pink mohawk, or a skin or hair color out of the ordinary for the region. Many distinctive features are only distinctive in certain cultures or among certain classes. For example a pink mohawk would be unremarkable in a skate park or at a punk concert, while it would stand out in a business office or in a church. If a game is going to take place primarily or entirely in an area in which the features would be seen as normal, the character gets no points for the disadvantage.
