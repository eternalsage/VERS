Some characters just can’t help themselves. They have no manners, use vulgar language in polite company, or make passes at married women in front of their husbands. Maybe they don’t see a problem with their actions, or maybe they just don’t care. They may even think their actions are superior for one reason or another. Regardless, their uncouth mannerisms make them stand out and often stand in the way of their goals. A character can attempt to repress their unacceptable behavior (be on their best behavior, or watch their language, etc) with a Composure + Social Defense roll with a -2 penalty for a minor disadvantage or a -4 penalty for a major disadvantage.
