Otherwise good people can have dark deeds in their past or even be involved with them currently. These secrets are the kind of knowledge that can easily ruin their lives and are not the small secrets that normal people have. Examples of this level of secret would be embezzling from their company, helping to smuggle people into (or out of) the country, having been a part of a third world warlord’s death squad, or a past as a prostitute. As a rule of thumb, if the secret is not worth blackmailing the character over, it’s not a big enough to qualify. Of course, this is setting dependent, and a light game with a cheerful mood such as a game based on children’s TV program may find having a crush on the girl next door a big enough deal that it warrants the disadvantage (arguably, this very situation usually comes up with a correspondingly light-hearted blackmail attempt such as the character’s brownie at lunch for the rest of the year, so it still meets the criteria). An observing character can make an Intuition + Perception roll vs the secret keeper’s Composure + Deception to notice when a character with this disadvantage tries to cover up or gloss over the secret, with success alerting the observer that something is amiss but not the nature or details about the secret.
