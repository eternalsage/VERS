Some characters have things they have to take care of, no matter what else is going on in their life. Maybe itâ€™s a loved one that is too young or infirm to care for themselves. Maybe she owns a business that employs hundreds of people and forms an economic backbone for a community. Or perhaps she is an elected official. Regardless of its source, a character with a responsibility must take care that their other adventures do not compromise their ability to carry out their duties, and as a corollary any villain who knows of this responsibility could use it as a target to get at the character. A responsibility that is a minor disadvantage needs attention on a roughly weekly schedule (maybe a little more, maybe a little less based on the exact nature of the responsibility) while a major responsibility needs daily attention (on average).
