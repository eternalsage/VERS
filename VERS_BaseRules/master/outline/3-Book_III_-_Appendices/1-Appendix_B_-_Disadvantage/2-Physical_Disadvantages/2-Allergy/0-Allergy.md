A character with an allergy is unable to come into contact with a certain substance without having an autoimmune reaction in which the body mistakenly attacks itself. Many people have allergies, especially to food items and pollen, usually triggered by simply coming into physical contact with the substance. Minor allergies cause uncomfortable symptoms like itching, sore throat, watery eyes, and running noses, and give characters suffering from them a -2 penalty to all actions. Major allergies on the other hand are life threatening situations which make even breathing difficult, giving characters a -4 to all actions and reducing their Vitality by one point per 10 minutes because of anaphylactic shock.
