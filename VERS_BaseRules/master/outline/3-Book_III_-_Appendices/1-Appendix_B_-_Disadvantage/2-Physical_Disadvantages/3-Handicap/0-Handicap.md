Maybe it was an accident, or maybe it was congenital. Either way the character has some type of physical handicap that prevents him from some action (or actions) that “normal” characters take for granted. This may affect senses, such as blindness or deafness, or affect the character more overtly, such as cerebral palsy or even the loss of a limb. Whether this is a minor setback or an impossible obstacle depends on the tone of the game (and the technology/magic available). Because of this in addition to the sensitive nature of the subject matter, a GM must come to a consensus not just with the player but with the group as a whole before allowing the disadvantage.
