Everyone has a disadvantage. Something that makes them unique, special, quirky, or the like. Maybe it’s unpleasant, or something that can be eventually seen past. Maybe it’s even endearing. But regardless, we all have them. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but it should give you a good starting point no matter what genre you are playing in.
